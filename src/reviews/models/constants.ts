      'What makes the newest Big Thief album <em>Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You </em>so compelling? When comparing their careers to their many folk-tinged woodstock-treasuring contemporaries it seems both critical and public adoration should have waned by now, but instead attention has escalated with each release. Like it or not, Big Thief is one of the select few musical projects that will define our era, and <em>DNWMIBIY </em>cements a still developing legacy of sustained creativity and rejuvenation. This four studio traipse on a 20 track double LP reeks of bloat, and yet any of the standard fare, curmudgeonly complaints of length and imbalance are met with a tongue-in-cheek smile and a know-it-all shrug. The absurd earnestness of the package transcends the individual value of these hodgepodge recordings to create their greatest statement yet. Their gleefully earthy and kindred band image requires a full buy-in for maximum enjoyment, but goddamnit are they good salesmen. While the group will chalk up 2019’s pair of albums to creative spirit more than anything else, these four indie darlings know the frequently overlooked value in a rock’n’roll release with a narrative<em>. </em>Quips like<em> </em>“Oh did you know this was recorded in 4 sessions?” and “Yeah, that album is actually the sister release to their previous one” are the lifeblood of unmusical blockheads such as myself, and are quite an effective marketing tool. Big Thief are discerning enough to tinker with the album as a still-malleable format, reminiscent of earlier pop visionaries who defined what a LP would mean to subsequent generations. In a landscape where most indie artists have settled to consistently churning out releases that are more or less the same, these backward looking impulses counterintuitively broke the mold.<em> </em>Gimmicks aside, <em>DNWMIBIY </em>is inspired from start to finish. This album may lack the immediacy of <em>Two Hands</em>, or a surefire hit like “Shark Smile”, but makes up for those deficiencies through the sheer inundation of its ideas. There is no standout side, and while there are some noticeable differences in production quality and instrumentation from studio to studio, there are no discernable smaller statements within this LP either. This is a true-blue front to back listen, a slow burning exercise in musical exploration from an uncannily self-attuned band. Big Thief have proven themselves tasteful enough to know that this oversaturation is only effective for so long; we can only hope their next chapter is as riveting as <em>DNWMIBIY.</em>',

      'Let\'s get the personal bias out of the way: <expandableText text="I like Hum" hiddenText="This particular subgenre of feedback-laden guitar based drone is the most pleasing thing to come out of the 90’s. In some ways it feels like the aesthetic conclusion of a particular brand of 90’s slacker duderock"></expandableText>, this record sounds like Hum. I like this record --<em> a lot</em>. The Indiana trio have been mining a particular vein of sludgy space rock for nearly a decade at this point, effectively leading the pack of shoegaze inspired bands who have captured the attention of the indie journalists in the last few years. <em>Dissolution Wave</em> is the culmination of all Cloakroom’s previous outings, a breakaway point where the project has imprinted their identity in the quintessentially midwestern celestial dust bowl. Album opener “Lost Meaning” serves as a palette cleanser, an explosive introduction to the heaviest wall of sound in the entire album, before receding into an atmospheric slow jam. This two part call to action delivers on their already well trodden sonic palette and asks the listener to take a large leap of faith for what lies ahead -- “Are you with me?”<br><br>Title track “Dissolution Wave” is the first indication of the changes the group have made since 2017’s <em>Time Well</em>. The deliberately lax rhythm feels like landing in uncharted territory, all the while lead singer Doyle Martin takes the part of the world-weary, well-trodden explorer. The track is one of the many more structured voyages on <em>Dissolution Wave</em> that allow Cloakroom to explore their constant themes of alienation within the more traditional songwriting structure, giving their lyrics a more confessional twist within the usually impersonal world of Metal-Infused Shoegaze: “Lately I\'ve been getting a little hard to love, harder to drug/ Everyone I know is getting harder to know/ Maybe I should too.” Lead single “A Force at Play”<em> </em>takes it further with &nbsp;lyrics written from the perspective of a pensive asteroid miner in a post-apocalyptic environment, punctuated by twinkling keys and wistful halcyonian tones. It’s &nbsp;the most narratively focused track on the record. \'I was a daydream/ A sight to be seen/ Bottling lightning beams for you”. This would be a good time to talk about the fact that this<em> is</em> a concept album. Unlike the story driven likes of The Who’s <em>Tommy</em> or Fucked Up’s <em>David Comes to Life</em>, the concept here is mostly a conduit for some superb songwriting, flirting with the subject matter in an impressionistic manner instead. A great example can be found on the closing track of the first side, <expandableText text="“Dottie-back Thrush”" hiddenText="My personal favorite of the songs that truly qualify as heavy shoegaze. What an ending..."></expandableText>. The economic lines “Do me this simple kindness/ Know this milk and honey magic has to take/ Dulling down the blade” hardly evoke the bloated excessed found in what traditionally qualifies as a concept album.<br><br>The second half of this album repeats the first &nbsp;in an ABBA structure, just without the theatrical presentation of the former. There are still two sizably heavier songs sandwiching lighter, atmospheric numbers. While “Fear of Being Fixed” and album closer “Dissembler” are more than serviceable, the back to back <expandableText text="“Lambspring”" hiddenText="Seems to be a reference to the Book of Lambspring, although I cant find much information on it. It\'s wild though, look it up."></expandableText> and<em> </em>“Doubts”<em> </em>manage to be the true highlight of the album. Specific praise needs to be piled onto Doyle Martin’s vocal performance on “Doubts”, a confidently downtempo croon &nbsp;that transmutes their previous flirtations with Americana into the genuine artifact; predicting the sound of a space-age top-40 country radio station. “Dissembler” is our sendoff, encapsulating all that has come before – more sludge, more riffs, and tempo changes we have now come to expect. The track ends with an abrupt cut from festival-tent indie to what I imagine lounge music sounds like on Jupiter, strung-out vaporwave gutted of any momentum or context. If <em>Dissolution Wave</em> asks us to take a leap with them, Cloakroom is confident they can stick the landing.<br><br><a href="https://cloakroom.bandcamp.com/album/dissolution-wave" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>Listen on Bandcamp</u></a>',

      '<em>Hey, I made you a mixtape, </em>whispers FKA Twigs at the onset of her new project <em>CAPRISONGS. Because when I feel you, I feel me. </em>Seems like listeners’ vibes fuel her uncanny ability to realize heady concepts exactly as they were envisioned – without this mutualism she might not have sharpened her grit to the point where the seamless integration of <expandableText text="poledancing" hiddenText="learned in the span of a year, while she was recovering from the removal of six fibroid tumors"></expandableText> into her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84"><u>artistry</u></a> is no longer a surprise. She doesn’t hide how hard she’s worked; she wears her sweat on her sleeve. Nobody watches the self-directed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYU3j-22360"><u>video</u></a> for twigs’ forcefully experimental EP <em>M3LL155X, </em>or witnesses the visceral dramaticism of her last LP\'s <expandableText text="live shows" hiddenText="featuring fantastical swordplay and furious tap-dancing"></expandableText>, without imagining the heapload of tenacity and brainpower it must take to create something so cohesive and affecting.<br></br>Proper mixtapes tend to be spontaneous and frivolous, two words you would never associate with twigs’ past releases. <em>CAPRISONGS</em> is a different beast though.<em> </em>Made during quarantine by consulting collaborators via Facetime, it feels like the product of studio downtime. Odds and ends of pop experiments are strung together with clips of twigs conversing with friends; they’re peeks at the human behind the artist. The tracks catch her in the glow of companions, lending more optimistic outlooks than she’s typically known for: “You can be careless with me” is a line that would have previously carried a dangerous sensuality, but on “careless” it lies on a bed of softly fluttering beats sheeted in Daniel Caesar’s silky hums, becoming a declaration of trust in her partner. The stargazing melody of “lightbeamers” evokes wonder as twigs advises listeners to put affirmations like “you are the perfect view” in your phone for a rainy day – a far cry from her dejected sense of self laid bare in <em>MAGDALENE</em>.<br></br>The plasticity of the mixtape format allows twigs to flex her vocal cords in new ways. On “darjeeling” she abandons her airy falsetto for a full-bodied sing-rap, while her playful “baby baby”s on “honda” have the sultry confidence of Janelle Monáe. The beats are spartan and agile, bringing twigs’ voice to the forefront while leaving room for sudden flourishes like the hyperpop screeches on “ride the dragon.”<br></br>Despite its fluidity, sometimes <em>CAPRISONGS </em>feels too concocted – the trappy “tears in the club” with The Weeknd seems like a calculated hit, breaking the illusion of the mixtape’s spontaneity. Cassette tapes click <expandableText text="ad nauseam" hiddenText="we get it twigs, it\'s a mixtape!"></expandableText>, and some skits should’ve been <expandableText text="scrapped" hiddenText="especially the creepy astrology reading on \'christi interlude\'"></expandableText>. Nonetheless, imperfections like these can be overlooked, because, after all, it’s a mixtape.<br></br>The last track and only true ballad on the project, “thank you song,” is home to a revelation: “Love in motion seems to save me now.” It aptly describes the best application of <em>CAPRISONGS </em>– use it to look at the future with affection. It will give an energy boost for tough times ahead, just like a <expandableText text="Capri Sun" hiddenText="yes, I know the mixtape\'s name was inspired by astrology and not the legendary drink, but how many chances am I really going to get to make Capri Sun analogies?"></expandableText>.',
