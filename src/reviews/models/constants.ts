    content: `<em>Hey, I made you a mixtape, </em>whispers FKA Twigs at the onset of her new project <em>CAPRISONGS. Because when I feel you, I feel me. </em>Seems like listeners’ vibes fuel her uncanny ability to realize heady concepts exactly as they were envisioned – without this mutualism she might not have sharpened her grit to the point where the seamless integration of <expandableText text="poledancing" hiddenText="learned in the span of a year, while she was recovering from the removal of six fibroid tumors"></expandableText> into her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84"><u>artistry</u></a> is no longer a surprise. She doesn’t hide how hard she’s worked; she wears her sweat on her sleeve. Nobody watches the self-directed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYU3j-22360"><u>video</u></a> for twigs’ forcefully experimental EP <em>M3LL155X, </em>or witnesses the visceral dramaticism of her last LP's <expandableText text="live shows" hiddenText="featuring fantastical swordplay and furious tap-dancing"></expandableText>, without imagining the heapload of tenacity and brainpower it must take to create something so cohesive and affecting.\n<br></br>Proper mixtapes tend to be spontaneous and frivolous, two words you would never associate with twigs’ past releases. <em>CAPRISONGS</em> is a different beast though.<em> </em>Made during quarantine by consulting collaborators via Facetime, it feels like the product of studio downtime. Odds and ends of pop experiments are strung together with clips of twigs conversing with friends; they’re peeks at the human behind the artist. The tracks catch her in the glow of companions, lending more optimistic outlooks than she’s typically known for: “You can be careless with me” is a line that would have previously carried a dangerous sensuality, but on “careless” it lies on a bed of softly fluttering beats sheeted in Daniel Caesar’s silky hums, becoming a declaration of trust in her partner. The stargazing melody of “lightbeamers” evokes wonder as twigs advises listeners to put affirmations like “you are the perfect view” in your phone for a rainy day – a far cry from her dejected sense of self laid bare in <em>MAGDALENE</em>.\n<br></br>The plasticity of the mixtape format allows twigs to flex her vocal cords in new ways. On “darjeeling” she abandons her airy falsetto for a full-bodied sing-rap, while her playful “baby baby”s on “honda” have the sultry confidence of Janelle Monáe. The beats are spartan and agile, bringing twigs’ voice to the forefront while leaving room for sudden flourishes like the hyperpop screeches on “ride the dragon.”\n<br></br>Despite its fluidity, sometimes <em>CAPRISONGS </em>feels too concocted – the trappy “tears in the club” with The Weeknd seems like a calculated hit, breaking the illusion of the mixtape’s spontaneity. Cassette tapes click <expandableText text="ad nauseam" hiddenText="we get it twigs, it's a mixtape!"></expandableText>, and some skits should’ve been <expandableText text="scrapped" hiddenText="especially the creepy astrology reading on 'christi interlude'"></expandableText>. Nonetheless, imperfections like these can be overlooked, because, after all, it’s a mixtape.\n<br></br>The last track and only true ballad on the project, “thank you song,” is home to a revelation: “Love in motion seems to save me now.” It aptly describes the best application of <em>CAPRISONGS </em>– use it to look at the future with affection. It will give an energy boost for tough times ahead, just like a <expandableText text="Capri Sun" hiddenText="yes, I know the mixtape's name was inspired by astrology and not the legendary drink, but how many chances am I really going to get to make Capri Sun analogies?"></expandableText>.`,
