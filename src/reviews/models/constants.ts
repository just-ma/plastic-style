    content: `I go to Union Pool on Friday night to see <a href="https://grouper.bandcamp.com/album/the-original-faces"><u>Helen</u></a> play. I meet my friend Megan there at 7:30 and immediately get a shot of tequila and a Budweiser. We run into <a href="https://www.plasticstyle.net/features/an-interview-with-samara-lubelski"><u>Samara Lubelski</u></a> in the outdoor area, where there is a bar, a taco truck, and a plethora of wooden benches. There is also a water cooler, my favorite. We say hi to <expandableText text = "Samara" hiddenText = "Samara if you're reading this I promise you won't be mentioned in every show review"> </expandableText> and she introduces us to some friends she’s talking to. One of them is the bassist for Helen. I realize I don’t want to be one of those guys who arrives in the middle of a conversation and lingers despite having no idea what is being talked about, so Megan and I walk a few feet away and discuss the current state of music journalism because we are very serious music journalists.<br></br><custom id = "cooler-pic"></custom> <br></br>Samara starts playing at 8:20. She is playing solo violin in a drone-like manner, just like every time I’ve seen her play. It is my third time seeing her and this time I am not too anchored to the performance. My thoughts wander but since I decided to leave my earplugs out, every time she plays a higher, more piercing note, my eyes fall out of my head and land back on the stage. It is semi-hypnotic.<br></br> <custom id = "samara-pic-2"></custom> <br></br>I forgot to mention that I was drinking a tall can of Kostritzer during Samara’s performance. Kostritzer is a dark German beer that we have on draft at the restaurant I work at. It was $8 but the bartender originally told me it was $9. He apologized and said he works at <expandableText text = "four" hiddenText = "I don't actually remember how many bars he worked at but four feels like the right number"></expandableText> bars. I was not upset.<br></br> <custom id = "kotz-pic"></custom><br></br>Helen starts playing while I’m in the bathroom. I quickly purchase another Kostritzer and stand behind all the other people watching Helen play. I decide to put in my earplugs but as it turns out they were missing from my keychain container the entire time. Because of this when Megan asks if I want to move closer to the stage I decline.<br></br><custom id = "helen-pic"></custom><br></br>The drums and bass of Helen, played by the two band members who aren’t Liz Harris from Grouper, are pretty loud and drown out Liz’s voice even more than a Grouper song. The songs were high quality shoegaze and Liz dispersed some very nice fuzz with the guitar she was playing.<br></br><custom id = "helen-vid"></custom><br></br>After the show Megan and I meet <a href="https://www.plasticstyle.net/lists/bens-low-effort-ep-list"><u>Ben</u></a> at one of his favorite cocktail bars. It is not that good and Ben is very drunk. I order an espresso martini, my favorite, and Ben makes fun of me. When the drink arrives he tastes it and emphatically tells me it is a great coffee drink.<br></br><custom id = "ben-pic"></custom>`,

    content: `I usually listen to Midwife right before bed. This is a relaxing experience, but it does run the risk that I will have sad dreams. The new Midwife album has a spiderweb on the cover, with a door caught in the middle. The way to new places and new opportunities stuck smack dab in a predator’s trap. Similar juxtapositions can be found in the album’s lyrics: “The hounds of heaven / Run like hell.” <br></br> <custom id = "door-pic" > </custom> <br></br>The journey of <em>Orbweaving </em>is interesting. The two quietest songs sandwich the album. The title track is last, a twelve minute ambient song that sounds like The Void. Maybe that’s what lies on the other side of the stuck door. Maybe it’s a good thing the door is closed.`,

    content: `On Saturday I went to Ergot Records to see Joanne Robertson play. I hadn't heard her stuff, but my friends said she was good. I ran into <a href = https://www.plasticstyle.net/features/an-interview-with-samara-lubelski > <u>Samara Lubelski</u></a> there. She was close friends with Joanne, but hadn’t seen her perform. It was hot in the room, and the sparsely plucked acoustics of the opener somehow made the air more humid. Joanne went on an hour after I arrived. Surprisingly she was playing electric guitar, not acoustic. <br></br> <custom id = "joanne-vid"></custom> <br></br>In between songs Joanne muttered, wondering what she should play and commenting on the increasing heat in the small record store lit with two dim red lightbulbs. I swayed, partially because I was tired but also because the music was making me. <br></br><custom id = "ergot-pic"> </custom> <br></br>“I think I need some whiskey” said Joanne after one of the songs. She was offered whisky or mezcal from the back of the record store - she was mostly unfamiliar with mezcal (“that’s what they put in margaritas, right?”) but chose it anyway. <br></br> <custom id = "mezcal-pic"> </custom>`,

    artist: 'Hallelujahs',
    author: 'Ben Langdon',
    content: `The glimmering psychedelia of the Japanese group Hallelujahs describe an adolescence more cosmic and vaporous than their twee peers in Beat Happening and Shonen Knife. This precursive outfit to Nagisa Ni Te is a supergroup of future indie stars, featuring members of Hijokaidan, Ché-SHIZU, and Idiot O’Clock. Originally released in 1986 as the first record on Shinji Shibayama’s label ORG Records and reissued last year by Black Editions, Hallelujahs’ sole album <em>Eat Meat, Swear an Oath </em>could be considered the second ever slowcore release.<br></br>"I’m Not Green" opens <em>Eat Meat</em> on a deceptively somber note. Amidst a doleful-yet-determined guitar that feels born out of a hot midsummer apartment, there is a sense of guilt and unrecognized pain: “Within this body that made you swell/ There’s a voice that stabs like a knife.” Frontman Shinji Shibayama has set the tone for the album – youth on the cusp of understanding, tentatively reaching out into the unknown. The next few tracks slow things down, meditating on the undefined yearnings of adolescence, whether in the search for self on “The Next Verse” or early regrets on “Hallelujah.” These songs are a snapshot of where independent music would be headed a decade later, tonally sitting somewhere between Slint and Cat Power.<br></br>Album highlight “I’ll Soon Follow, No Matter Where You Are” abruptly shifts the mood with an opening guitar lick that outdoes Galaxie 500 a year before they formed. The track is blisteringly optimistic, an anthem to the power of human connection. It celebrates the larger-than-life promises we make to ourselves in youth, and the joy that comes with believing them to be possible. The back half of the album continues in this playful tone: “Green Lovers” serves as the antithesis to “I’m Not Green'' by focusing on the bright innocence found early in a relationship. However impressive and earnest these feelings may be, Hallelujahs are always fixated on their impermanence.<br></br>“Christmas Out Of Season,” the weightiest track on <em>Eat Meat, </em>revisits earlier themes of isolation and heartbreak with instrumentation made out of molasses. Featuring drone-like guitar punctuated with dissonant solos, this track is closest to what could be called slowcore today. “Christmas Out of Season” is also one of two contributions from other band members. The vocals for the album were all recorded in one take and mostly performed by Shinji Shibayama alone, while “Hallelujah” and “Christmas Out Of Season” were written and performed by band members Naoki Zushi and Takahisa Watanabe respectively. Shibayama described the process as “a feeling of discomfort like that you experience when you hear your voice on tape for the very first time.” The effect all these years later is not too different from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Records"><u>K Records</u></a> or Daniel Johnston release, but the strange pacing and immaculate guitar work give this album a rarefied, timeless quality.<br></br>The final two tracks “Star” and “A Wish” pair nicely as a closing moodpiece. Rather than dwell on the larger than life emotions of adolescence, these songs provide the comfort of the day to day, like talking with a friend late into the night. Throughout writing this review this album has grown on me to the extent where it feels like a lifelong friend, I can only hope more people can share this experience.<br></br> <custom id = "halle-vid"></custom>`,

    content: `<em>"Croydon Fox" is the first release from NYC-based duo Strange Flesh, who previously recorded as <a href="https://thecasualsexists.bandcamp.com/"><u>The Casual Sexists</u></a></em>.<br></br>When I listen to "Croydon Fox" I'm not sure if I'm prowling or the one being prowled upon. At first I skittered along with the beat and was down with the slinky refrain (“My favorite time of day is night”), but singer Varrick’s cold, cutting delivery is straight up scary and so is the shaky piano and wobbling bass. Lines like “I slide into prosaic form to feed your night terrors” are spoken with such unsettling calm that they make me feel like I’m the prey trembling behind a dark tree in the forest.<br></br>“Croydon’s Revenge” is more playful and a bit more danceable, and actually cute too with its sampled cat noises and raccoon-knocking-over-a-trash-bin sounds.<br></br>“Croydon Dub” takes it back to the dark side, shaping a mirrorland of shredded echos. It's “Croydon Fox” heard through a hazy dream where you can't wake up.<br></br>The dazzling cherry on top is the video for “Croydon’s Fox,” which features a <expandableText text="scary fox man" hiddenText="the homemade fox mask worn is, dare I say, suave??"></expandableText> doing spooky things in dark places and intermittently dancing.

    author: 'Ben Langdon',
    content: `While styles of japanese music from the 70’s and 80’s like Wamono and City Pop are in a period of renaissance boosted by the youtube algorithm, psych rock outfits like Les Rallizes Dénudés manage to persist on the outskirts, thriving within an entirely different ecosystem. This is not to say the group isn’t popular, in fact they are currently experiencing a second wave of rediscovery, likely larger than the initial wave of interest for Japanese psych bands inspired by international record divers like Julian Cope. The group's appeal has stemmed as much from the questionable circumstances around the group as the actual music; even with their relative popularity, the mystique surrounding frontman Takashi Mizutani and the scarcity of recordings have kept the Rallizes as one of the final frontiers of musical discovery. Becoming a fan meant only more unanswered questions and dead ends, until now at least.<br></br>Every conversation including the group feels obligated to mention how the original bassist hijacked a plane and fled to North Korea in 1970. While this fledgling communist had minimal impact on the scattershot recordings and bootlegs drip-fed to the international audience, this nugget of trivia was engineered in a vacuum to make neurotic record collectors lose their shit. In a twist of cruel irony, sole consistent member and project frontman Takashi Mizutani’s famed recalcitrance only stoked the flames of this interest. Similar to country blues archivists’ focus on folklore and eccentric individuals, the growing interest in international (Japanese) recordings from western audiences seemed to be centered on similar sorts of myth-making to the point of objectification. This unhealthy relationship led to countless misinformative bootlegs of poor quality that were never condoned or approved by the group.<br></br>The one time member of Les Rallizes Dénudés and founder of The Sunset Gang, Makoto Kubota, is helping reclaim the band’s true legacy by remastering and releasing all of Mizutani’s proper recordings, starting with the <em>OZ Tapes</em>. These tapes were recorded during the brief life of the DIY space OZ -- along with Acid Seven and the Taj Mahal Travelers -- and chronicle the band's passage from a traditional songwriting approach found on<em> Mizutani</em> to the throbbing psychedelic freakouts the group would later become known for.<br></br>The OZ Tapes throw the listener right in the middle of the Rallizes’ transition, with the first tracks full of meatier rhythms and less feedback than one finds on the Rallizes’ later recordings -- as much Buffalo Springfield as the Velvets. Disc 2 consists of a 22 minute performance of “The Last One_1970” which manages to achieve a semblance of psychedelic bliss through its sheer repetition, but ultimately doesn't stray far from the already established formula.<br></br>The true excitement begins with disc 3: “Vertigo Otherwise My Conviction” finds Rallizes at their prime and reconfigures an otherwise average set of tunes into something far more rewarding and ephemeral. “Vertigo” finds Mizutani’s guitarwork more confident and hypnotic, complimenting an equally impressive rhythm section. The album concludes with a turbulent reprisal of “The Last One” which finds the group fully locked in with a 15 minute stretch of prime improvisational chaos. It would be a confusing choice for most bands to have their “triumphant return” feature the same song twice, but the Rallizes benefit from this treatment. Their relatively limited song catalog achieved near-perfection through constant experimentation and iteration. The chance to glimpse this process through the unfiltered lens of the <em>OZ tapes</em> is the recording’s best feature.<br></br>OZ Tapes is an incredibly interesting listen and a more important event, this might be the only time such an ungovernable band has so many layers of half-truths and beliefs stripped away so many decades after their career. While this record may temper some outsized expectations, this reclamation of the band's legacy is ultimately a healthy archival step and a wonderful snapshot as a group whose golden years were just getting started.`,

      'What makes the newest Big Thief album <em>Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You </em>so compelling? When comparing their careers to their many folk-tinged woodstock-treasuring contemporaries it seems both critical and public adoration should have waned by now, but instead attention has escalated with each release. Like it or not, Big Thief is one of the select few musical projects that will define our era, and <em>DNWMIBIY </em>cements a still developing legacy of sustained creativity and rejuvenation. This four studio traipse on a 20 track double LP reeks of bloat, and yet any of the standard fare, curmudgeonly complaints of length and imbalance are met with a tongue-in-cheek smile and a know-it-all shrug. The absurd earnestness of the package transcends the individual value of these hodgepodge recordings to create their greatest statement yet. Their gleefully earthy and kindred band image requires a full buy-in for maximum enjoyment, but goddamnit are they good salesmen. While the group will chalk up 2019’s pair of albums to creative spirit more than anything else, these four indie darlings know the frequently overlooked value in a rock’n’roll release with a narrative<em>. </em>Quips like<em> </em>“Oh did you know this was recorded in 4 sessions?” and “Yeah, that album is actually the sister release to their previous one” are the lifeblood of unmusical blockheads such as myself, and are quite an effective marketing tool. Big Thief are discerning enough to tinker with the album as a still-malleable format, reminiscent of earlier pop visionaries who defined what a LP would mean to subsequent generations. In a landscape where most indie artists have settled to consistently churning out releases that are more or less the same, these backward looking impulses counterintuitively broke the mold.<em> </em>Gimmicks aside, <em>DNWMIBIY </em>is inspired from start to finish. This album may lack the immediacy of <em>Two Hands</em>, or a surefire hit like “Shark Smile”, but makes up for those deficiencies through the sheer inundation of its ideas. There is no standout side, and while there are some noticeable differences in production quality and instrumentation from studio to studio, there are no discernable smaller statements within this LP either. This is a true-blue front to back listen, a slow burning exercise in musical exploration from an uncannily self-attuned band. Big Thief have proven themselves tasteful enough to know that this oversaturation is only effective for so long; we can only hope their next chapter is as riveting as <em>DNWMIBIY.</em>',

      'Let\'s get the personal bias out of the way: <expandableText text="I like Hum" hiddenText="This particular subgenre of feedback-laden guitar based drone is the most pleasing thing to come out of the 90’s. In some ways it feels like the aesthetic conclusion of a particular brand of 90’s slacker duderock"></expandableText>, this record sounds like Hum. I like this record --<em> a lot</em>. The Indiana trio have been mining a particular vein of sludgy space rock for nearly a decade at this point, effectively leading the pack of shoegaze inspired bands who have captured the attention of the indie journalists in the last few years. <em>Dissolution Wave</em> is the culmination of all Cloakroom’s previous outings, a breakaway point where the project has imprinted their identity in the quintessentially midwestern celestial dust bowl. Album opener “Lost Meaning” serves as a palette cleanser, an explosive introduction to the heaviest wall of sound in the entire album, before receding into an atmospheric slow jam. This two part call to action delivers on their already well trodden sonic palette and asks the listener to take a large leap of faith for what lies ahead -- “Are you with me?”<br><br>Title track “Dissolution Wave” is the first indication of the changes the group have made since 2017’s <em>Time Well</em>. The deliberately lax rhythm feels like landing in uncharted territory, all the while lead singer Doyle Martin takes the part of the world-weary, well-trodden explorer. The track is one of the many more structured voyages on <em>Dissolution Wave</em> that allow Cloakroom to explore their constant themes of alienation within the more traditional songwriting structure, giving their lyrics a more confessional twist within the usually impersonal world of Metal-Infused Shoegaze: “Lately I\'ve been getting a little hard to love, harder to drug/ Everyone I know is getting harder to know/ Maybe I should too.” Lead single “A Force at Play”<em> </em>takes it further with &nbsp;lyrics written from the perspective of a pensive asteroid miner in a post-apocalyptic environment, punctuated by twinkling keys and wistful halcyonian tones. It’s &nbsp;the most narratively focused track on the record. \'I was a daydream/ A sight to be seen/ Bottling lightning beams for you”. This would be a good time to talk about the fact that this<em> is</em> a concept album. Unlike the story driven likes of The Who’s <em>Tommy</em> or Fucked Up’s <em>David Comes to Life</em>, the concept here is mostly a conduit for some superb songwriting, flirting with the subject matter in an impressionistic manner instead. A great example can be found on the closing track of the first side, <expandableText text="“Dottie-back Thrush”" hiddenText="My personal favorite of the songs that truly qualify as heavy shoegaze. What an ending..."></expandableText>. The economic lines “Do me this simple kindness/ Know this milk and honey magic has to take/ Dulling down the blade” hardly evoke the bloated excessed found in what traditionally qualifies as a concept album.<br><br>The second half of this album repeats the first &nbsp;in an ABBA structure, just without the theatrical presentation of the former. There are still two sizably heavier songs sandwiching lighter, atmospheric numbers. While “Fear of Being Fixed” and album closer “Dissembler” are more than serviceable, the back to back <expandableText text="“Lambspring”" hiddenText="Seems to be a reference to the Book of Lambspring, although I cant find much information on it. It\'s wild though, look it up."></expandableText> and<em> </em>“Doubts”<em> </em>manage to be the true highlight of the album. Specific praise needs to be piled onto Doyle Martin’s vocal performance on “Doubts”, a confidently downtempo croon &nbsp;that transmutes their previous flirtations with Americana into the genuine artifact; predicting the sound of a space-age top-40 country radio station. “Dissembler” is our sendoff, encapsulating all that has come before – more sludge, more riffs, and tempo changes we have now come to expect. The track ends with an abrupt cut from festival-tent indie to what I imagine lounge music sounds like on Jupiter, strung-out vaporwave gutted of any momentum or context. If <em>Dissolution Wave</em> asks us to take a leap with them, Cloakroom is confident they can stick the landing.<br><br><a href="https://cloakroom.bandcamp.com/album/dissolution-wave" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>Listen on Bandcamp</u></a>',

      '<em>Hey, I made you a mixtape, </em>whispers FKA Twigs at the onset of her new project <em>CAPRISONGS. Because when I feel you, I feel me. </em>Seems like listeners’ vibes fuel her uncanny ability to realize heady concepts exactly as they were envisioned – without this mutualism she might not have sharpened her grit to the point where the seamless integration of <expandableText text="poledancing" hiddenText="learned in the span of a year, while she was recovering from the removal of six fibroid tumors"></expandableText> into her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84"><u>artistry</u></a> is no longer a surprise. She doesn’t hide how hard she’s worked; she wears her sweat on her sleeve. Nobody watches the self-directed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYU3j-22360"><u>video</u></a> for twigs’ forcefully experimental EP <em>M3LL155X, </em>or witnesses the visceral dramaticism of her last LP\'s <expandableText text="live shows" hiddenText="featuring fantastical swordplay and furious tap-dancing"></expandableText>, without imagining the heapload of tenacity and brainpower it must take to create something so cohesive and affecting.<br></br>Proper mixtapes tend to be spontaneous and frivolous, two words you would never associate with twigs’ past releases. <em>CAPRISONGS</em> is a different beast though.<em> </em>Made during quarantine by consulting collaborators via Facetime, it feels like the product of studio downtime. Odds and ends of pop experiments are strung together with clips of twigs conversing with friends; they’re peeks at the human behind the artist. The tracks catch her in the glow of companions, lending more optimistic outlooks than she’s typically known for: “You can be careless with me” is a line that would have previously carried a dangerous sensuality, but on “careless” it lies on a bed of softly fluttering beats sheeted in Daniel Caesar’s silky hums, becoming a declaration of trust in her partner. The stargazing melody of “lightbeamers” evokes wonder as twigs advises listeners to put affirmations like “you are the perfect view” in your phone for a rainy day – a far cry from her dejected sense of self laid bare in <em>MAGDALENE</em>.<br></br>The plasticity of the mixtape format allows twigs to flex her vocal cords in new ways. On “darjeeling” she abandons her airy falsetto for a full-bodied sing-rap, while her playful “baby baby”s on “honda” have the sultry confidence of Janelle Monáe. The beats are spartan and agile, bringing twigs’ voice to the forefront while leaving room for sudden flourishes like the hyperpop screeches on “ride the dragon.”<br></br>Despite its fluidity, sometimes <em>CAPRISONGS </em>feels too concocted – the trappy “tears in the club” with The Weeknd seems like a calculated hit, breaking the illusion of the mixtape’s spontaneity. Cassette tapes click <expandableText text="ad nauseam" hiddenText="we get it twigs, it\'s a mixtape!"></expandableText>, and some skits should’ve been <expandableText text="scrapped" hiddenText="especially the creepy astrology reading on \'christi interlude\'"></expandableText>. Nonetheless, imperfections like these can be overlooked, because, after all, it’s a mixtape.<br></br>The last track and only true ballad on the project, “thank you song,” is home to a revelation: “Love in motion seems to save me now.” It aptly describes the best application of <em>CAPRISONGS </em>– use it to look at the future with affection. It will give an energy boost for tough times ahead, just like a <expandableText text="Capri Sun" hiddenText="yes, I know the mixtape\'s name was inspired by astrology and not the legendary drink, but how many chances am I really going to get to make Capri Sun analogies?"></expandableText>.',
