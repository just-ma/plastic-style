    content: `Codeine used to sound so boring to me. When I first listened to “D,” their classic bummed-out anthem off <em>Frigid Stars </em>and most popular song, the monotone verse felt like pure drudgery and some of the lyrics felt overly simplistic: “Take a smile / Make it sad.” But most of all, the music was so, so <em>slow</em>. And so sad. But I was in Ireland and the weather was dreary so I kept listening.<br></br>Now Codeine is one of my favorite bands. “D” got me into <em>Frigid Stars </em>and made me a fan throughout college, but I didn’t truly immerse myself in Codeine until a recent breakup. Turns out Codeine is best when emotions are rushing in at an unmanageable rate – songs like “Pickup Song” rein me in with laconic guitar, and once I’m calmed the wordless chorus bursts forth like water breaking a dam. The music is heavy, simultaneously minimal and deeply psychedelic.<br></br>Codeine was cathartic then but now that I have some distance from heartbreak, I can appreciate the vastness of their songs, towering monuments to past emotions. Sometimes it almost feels like a celebration of sadness, a reminder that we’re real.<br></br>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigid_Stars_LP"><u>best slowcore album of all time</u></a> was recorded on an 8-track in a Brooklyn basement.

    content: `Arab Strap’s “I Would Have Liked Me a Lot Last Night” is the comedown that the rest of Arab Strap’s sophomore LP, <em>Philophobia</em>, orbits around. Most Arab Strap songs are based on moments of lucidity that unwillingly dawn upon us in the middle of the party, similar to catching one's cocaine-addled reflection in the mirror, and the self-abasement that follows . “I Would Have Liked Me a Lot Last Night” inverts that dynamic, sympathetically looking at the cascade of emotions we have the next morning.<br></br>"You said we had a good time/I hear I was a right laugh/I really loved you a lot last night/I could've hugged you to death" <br></br>The repetitive and mournful backing track adds weight to what very well could be fleeting moments of kindness, while the narrator betrays a dim awareness as to the cyclical nature of his habits and interpersonal relationships, and how the end of one night is just the start of another (“I'm still trying to decide where the weekend ends”). The song closes with a tongue-in-cheek loop of some anti-drug propaganda, suggesting he's already been too soppy for one day. While most of us are liable to promise to never take it that far again while heaving into the toilet, “I Would Have Liked Me a Lot Last Night” dwells on the reasons why we ultimately will.`,

    author: 'Parker Albert and Ben Langdon',

    image: SLOWCORE,
    content: `<h2>Abstract</h2>A healthy body of literature has unanimously shown that for a slowcore band to be successful, they must be slow. But just how slow does one need to go, and who is the slowest of them all? These questions have remained unanswered for the thirty-plus years of slowcore’s existence. In a preliminary attempt to study this topic, we compiled a random sample of five catalog songs from each of the five most successful slowcore bands, and then measured the average BPM of each song list. It was predicted that Codeine or Low would be the slowest slowcore band. Our results indicated that a sample size of five was unsatisfactory for determining the overall slowness of each band. We then took the average BPM of each band’s entire discography – this was found to be a much more accurate indicator of a band’s overall slowness. Based on our results, Codeine is the slowest slowcore band of all time. The results were satisfactory to the researchers, especially to Parker, whose favorite slowcore band is Codeine. There is implication for future research on the relative slowness of slowcore compared to the slowness of other slow music.<br></br><h2>1. Introduction</h2>Slowcore is a genre that emerged in the 90’s, during a time when the rock mainstream was increasingly favoring heavier, more punk-like styles such as grunge. True to the name, the sound of slowcore is slow, guitar heavy rock, with a tendency towards somber melodies and melancholic lyrics. Early slowcore bands that set a blueprint for the genre include Low, Codeine, Seam, and Bedhead. Initial reaction to the genre was mixed – some fell head over heels for slowcore, while others didn’t get the appeal and were confounded by the style. While remaining influential for many rock acts, the number of pure slowcore bands dwindled significantly as the new millennium began.<br></br>Slowcore has seen a renaissance in recent years. The audience for original 90’s slowcore has grown drastically, while modern indie bands have increasingly drawn upon the sound of slowcore. New bands whose primary style is slowcore are emerging at a faster rate than they have in decades. With the saliency of slowcore at such a high level, it seemed an appropriate time as ever to delve into the question: what makes a slowcore band truly <em>slow</em>?<br></br><h2>2. Methods</h2>As the supreme surveyors of slowcore, we were qualified to select the five most successful slowcore bands based on pure intuition. The bands we selected included Codeine, Low, Acetone, Seam, and Bedhead (One may wonder why Duster was not included, but they're obviously drugged out spacey post-rock, and NOT slowcore). Every song within each band’s discography was assigned a number, with 1 being the first song the band released and continuing onward in chronological order. We used a random number generator with bounds set by the numerical range of each band’s released songs from 1990 to 2001 in order to get a random sample of five songs from each selected band. BPM was selected as the best indicator of a given song’s slowness. We used an online tool to find the average BPM for each five song sample. The API used by the tool required use of Spotify, which unfortunately restricted song selection to those available on Spotify. After determining the results of this preliminary study to be unsatisfactory, we took the average BPM of the entire discography for each band between 1990-2001 (every song that was available on Spotify).<br></br><h2>3. Results</h2>According to the results of our initial study that used a sample of five random songs for each artist (see Table 2), Codeine is the slowest slowcore band with an average of 101 BPM. Acetone, Seam, and Low had very similar averages, with 112 BPM, 114 BPM, and 116 BPM, respectively (see Table 1). Bedhead was an outlier with an average of 140 BPM (see chart 1).<br></br>For study 2 we averaged each band’s entire discography (that was available on Spotify), resulting in data that was less spread out (see chart 2) – Codeine had the lowest average: 102 BPM (an increase of one measure of BPM from study 1), while Bedhead had the highest: 124 BPM (a decrease of 16 measures of BPM from study 1). Low experienced the greatest change in average BPM from study 1 to study 2, decreasing from 116 BPM in study 1 to 103 BPM in study 2. Acetone and Seam experienced slight increases in BPM – Acetone increased from 112 BPM to 117 BPM, while Seam increased from 114 BPM to 116 BPM (see table 1).<br></br><h3>Table 1: Average BPM of Study 1 and 2</h3><custom id="table-one"></custom><h3>Table 2: BPM of Selected Codeine Songs</h3><custom id="table-two"></custom><h3>Chart 1: Average BPM of Study 2</h3><custom id="chart-one"></custom><h3>Chart 2: Average BPM of Study 2</h3><custom id="chart-two"></custom><h2>4.Conclusion</h2>The results of study 1 and 2 confirmed Parker’s hypothesis that Codeine is the best slowcore band. Although this made Parker very happy, it should be noted that there are several limitations to this study. Perhaps the biggest limitation is the use of BPM as the sole measure of a song’s slowness. Our study did not take into consideration the more subjective measure of how slow a song actually <em>feels</em>. For example, most Bedhead songs <em>feel </em>much slower than most Seam songs, but Seam had a much lower average BPM than Bedhead. This could be due to the possibility of a song being played in half time – which means that a song <em>feels </em>twice as slow as the song’s actual BPM. However, this would be a difficult quality to measure on a large scale as we did not have access to a tool that could identify when a song is played in half time. The tool we used was another limitation of our study, as it restricted us to only including songs that were available on Spotify. This was mostly an issue with Acetone’s catalog, who only have one album available on Spotify along with their later compilation. We also missed a single EP from Low in our data set.<br></br>One interesting feature of the online tool we used to measure BPM was that it would “rate” our playlists with a 5 star scale. It hated all of them for being too obscure and only filled with one artist, but it especially hated Low. The website gave them an average .3 stars less than the other bands with both the five song playlist and the full discography playlist. Naturally one is left to ask, “Hey what’s up with that?” We felt the same way, and thus recommend finding a less aggro BPM tool if one wishes to replicate our study.<br></br>So how does slowcore stack up against other music? We compared their BPM with the first slow album that popped into our heads, Scott Walker and Sun 0))’s collaboration <em>Soused. Soused </em>ended up clocking at 84, a full 18 less beats per minute than Codeine. Do better, slowcore.<br></br>What bands did we miss? What would be a better measure of “slowness?” What’s the slowest album you can think of?

    content: `What better way to celebrate Slowcore Week than with a forgotten country B-side from Mark Eitzel and Co.? “The Right Thing” was released on the back of the <em>Rise </em>EP, when the band was on the precipice of a radio friendly pivot ushered by some newfound success in the UK. While the resulting album <em>Everclear </em>might contain some of their most popular work, I cannot say it is my personal favorite. While revisiting the era I was ambivalent to some of the over-the-top production style and weakness in concept, but Eitzel does his best with the sort of larger than life emotion found in the language of the country standard, bringing a sharp wit and a turn of phrase that would make a young Jeff Tweedy blush. The track has a glibness to its delivery that borders on parody, but manages to stay earnest with some convincing performances all around. Reassuring the down-and-out is one of Americana's favorite preoccupations, and this song is a shining example.`,

    content: `“Teenage Spaceship” is a perfect example of romanticism in slowcore. Lacking the bitterness of Codeine or the apathy of Bedhead, Bill Callahan describes a mostly-undefiled and &nbsp;&nbsp;younger version of himself taking a midnight walk, absorbing his surroundings with the mystical solipsism where every discovery feels like the first, where every strip mall or suburban block is imbued with significance. While short and unambitious compared to the other classics on <em>Knock Knock</em>, “Teenage Spaceship” captures the feeling of youthful wonder better than anything else in his catalog.`,

    content: `Chris Brokaw is cold. So are the other 20 odd people gathered in <a href="https://www.propertyistheft.org/"><u>Property Is Theft</u></a> for one of the coldest sets Brooklyn’s seen this year. At the mic, he recalls a similarly frigid show he played with <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/89573-Come-2"><u>Come</u></a> once. “I’m colder now than I was then” he says.<br></br><br></br>One freezing show was all it took to sell me on the solo work of Chris Brokaw. I attended because Chris drummed for my favorite slowcore band, Codeine. But his many solo projects proved to be a treasure trove of solid rock songs and post-rock experiments, and I wanted to know more.<br></br><br></br><em>What was your first musical creation?</em><br></br><br></br>I remember writing little songs in my head when I was a kid. Just little bits. I never shared them with anyone (don't ask, they weren't particularly good). When I was 12 or 13 my friends and I would mess around with cassettes, kind of remixing songs we hated (The Eagles, etc). Again, nothing particularly brilliant. When I was 13 I started playing in a band with another guitarist and drummer and we wrote instrumental rock music.<br></br><br></br><em>If you had to pick, guitar or drums?</em><br></br><br></br>Guitar. I'm saying this in the desert island sense, like, at least I could play songs alone with guitar. I feel like I'm better at guitar than drums, though I think my drumming is improving.<br></br><br></br><em>With Numero’s </em><a href="https://numerogroup.com/blogs/stories/numero-twenty"><u><em>anniversary show</em></u></a><em> in LA and </em><a href="https://codeineband.bandcamp.com/album/dessau"><u><em>‘Dessau’</em></u></a><em> being given an official release, how does it feel to be reunited with Codeine for the second time?</em><br></br><br></br>It feels more relaxed and more natural than the reunion in 2012. Back then it felt more like I was in a time warp; now, Codeine music feels more eternal, like it's part of my life forever, not simply something from the past that I'm revisiting. I'm also really glad for the opportunity to spend more time with John and Steve.<br></br><br></br><em>Many Codeine fans, myself included, were not around for the band’s original incarnation. What did we miss out on?</em><br></br><br></br>We played shorter sets and we tried to be really loud. In some ways it was a bit more confrontational. I think the whole thing we were doing was more surprising then, somehow. Many people thought we were freaks and it could be a bit polarizing, though then as now the people who got it really got it.<br></br><br></br><em>Your show with Codeine at Union Pool was incredible, I couldn’t stop headbanging. How was it for you?</em><br></br><br></br>Both shows were exciting. I feel very comfortable in that music. It requires a lot of concentration. I enjoy the odd places it takes me physically.<br></br><br></br><em>One of my favorite parts of Codeine’s ‘Frigid Stars’ is your glacial approach to drumming. How’d you develop that style?</em><br></br><br></br>I developed that style for Codeine. Really, I developed it with John and Steve. I think we all adapted our playing for the purpose of playing Codeine music. It wasn't easy but once I got it together I think it changed me.<br></br><br></br><em>Any influences?</em><br></br><br></br>I could tell you some of my favorite drummers, though I'm not sure it would necessarily illuminate things?... Mitch Mitchell (Jimi Hendrix Experience), John Bonham (Led Zeppelin), Paul Cook (Sex Pistols), John Maher (Buzzcocks), Ben Koller (Converge), Britt Walford (Slint), John Herndon (Tortoise), Danny Richmond (Charles Mingus).<br></br><br></br><em>Aside from playing in Come, Codeine, The New Year, and The Lemonheads (just to name a few), you’ve released some great albums under your own name. When did you first start recording solo material?</em><br></br><br></br>I started writing a bunch of music around 1999/2000. I was still in Come and at that point anything I would have written would have been for Come, but I knew I didn't want this to be a Come record. I couldn't really put a name to it, but eventually concluded that it was going to be a solo album and I'd play everything. It was very unnerving but I spent about a year writing and recording demos for an album I eventually recorded called <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/2371450-Chris-Brokaw-Red-Cities"><u><em>Red Cities</em></u></a><em>.</em> I was obsessed, I couldn't really think about anything else for a year or so. It just kind of overtook me.<br></br><br></br><em>Your solo work has a wide range of sound and style, from droney guitar noise to cinematic post-rock to quieter, jazzier affairs. Does any particular style feel most “at home” to you?</em><br></br><br></br>That's a good question. Last night I was giving a guitar lesson and I taught this girl how to play "Ever Fallen In Love" by the Buzzcocks, and I felt like that style of music is the most natural thing in the world, or at least maybe the most natural thing to me.<br></br><br></br><em>Your most recent album ‘Puritan’ is a fantastic rock album replete with lyrics. Given that many of your releases are instrumental, is it an extra challenge to write lyrics?</em><br></br><br></br>Yes, it's a challenge, but when I get it right it's satisfying. I've become more exacting and critical about lyrics, but at the same time I also feel like songs take a life of their own and do what they will, and I try to allow that. They do things I don't necessarily want them to do but for me that's become a weirdly welcome, or inevitable, part of the process.<br></br><br></br><em>The lyrics of the </em><a href="https://chrisbrokaw12xu.bandcamp.com/album/puritan"><u><em>‘Puritan’</em></u></a><em> track “The Periscope Kids” include all the track titles of your 2015 album </em><a href="https://chrisbrokaw12xu.bandcamp.com/album/the-periscope-twins"><u><em>‘The Periscope Twins.’</em></u></a><em> I thought that was an interesting bit of worldbuilding, how did you build up to that?</em><br></br><br></br>I had the vocal song written but I wasn't ready to record it. But I referenced it on the instrumental album. Those lyrics were a bit of a veiled cry for help at a troubled period of my life and I guess I had to do it twice/incrementally.<br></br><br></br><em>The 2018 album (</em><a href="https://charnelground12xu.bandcamp.com/album/charnel-ground"><u><em>Charnel Ground</em></u></a><em>) you made with Kid Millions and James McNew is one of my favorite collaborations you’ve done. How did that project come about?</em><br></br><br></br>I'd met John (Kid Millions) through the music scene and we played a show in Brooklyn as a duo, kind of half songs and half jams. He suggested we record and about a week before the session he suggested inviting James. I thought it was a great idea. I love what we all did together! I'm very proud of that record. I brought in a couple of those pieces and the rest we made up in the studio. James only did the recording, and was replaced by Doug McCombs. We did a couple of small tours and some recordings (quite a while ago, I think in 2018??) and I hope we'll resume. Pandemic was not good for Charnel Ground.<br></br><br></br><em>You’re quite prolific, seems like every other week you release a new project or form a new band. What keeps you coming back for more?</em><br></br><br></br>Just being excited about music. And continuing to meet people and wanting to collaborate with them.<br></br><br></br><em>Are you working on any upcoming projects?</em><br></br><br></br>I'm in a new band here in Boston called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lupocittaband/?ref=py_c&amp;paipv=0&amp;eav=Afa2g6eXpIB4h0q43mJ3iw15H-5rzTt1KaHryA1JnooX-6HvZdWSyFFR4h1hjYUg990&amp;_rdr"><u>Lupo Citta</u></a>. Kind of garagey, and I'm mostly playing rhythm guitar, I definitely play in a different way than usual. I have a couple of other things I'm hoping will happen but they involve people in other states and I feel like that process may be harder now than it was for a while, partly due to the pandemic and what it did to me, which is that I want to be home more. I used to travel constantly and I no longer want to do that. I like being at home.`,

The hymn-like loop the narrator finds himself in reflects a numbness he desperately wants to break out of as the orchestral strings crescendo over the six minute runtime.

Marco Zenker takes advantage of the label’s tight aesthetics on 2022’s <em>Channel Balance</em>. It works within the bounds of Ilian Tape’s sound, but paradoxically expands its limits with Marco’s fine-tuned structure tinkering. “Wave Mode” sounds a bit like a rocking boat–synths spray into the beat like water on the bow – but Marco still manages to run a tight ship.<br></br><custom id="marco-vid"></custom>`,

    content: `The title of Sea Moss’s rambunctious track “Candy Run” reminds me of turbulent middle school years when everybody was either playing Candy Crush or Temple Run on their phone. Everyone had their nose to the grindstone during lunchtime, and now I'm imagining my clumsy, slightly chubby 11-year-old-self slipping on the cafeteria floor and “Candy Run” wouldn't be a bad soundtrack to the sight. The track has a stutter-stop rambunctiousness, but behind the scenes I think it’s a little more thought out than chaotic middle school me. The shouted, nearly indecipherable vocals remind me of <a href="https://prrfectpussy.bandcamp.com/album/say-yes-to-love"><u>Perfect Pussy</u></a>, but the squeals and grunts of a synth and the clutter of cowbell-saturated drums make “Candy Crush” a lot more playful. Taken all together, this sounds way fresher than a cafeteria lunch.<br></br><custom id="sea-vid"></custom>`,

And sure it shares the sweeping reverb of that grand debut, but it doesn't evoke sun shimmers, instead cave glimmers. It's a comfy cave though, the finish line for a restless album full of sharp turns into shoegaze, grindcore, and ambient. Maybe it’s less of a cave and more of a bathhouse.

    content: `The sampled beats on “The Hybrid” are desperately trying to escape Fatboi Sharif’s maniacal talk-rap flow – bass drum thumps on an invisible wall and snare scrambles to find anything to grab hold of. But the track is dark and cavernous; delayed reverb on Sharif’s voice obliterates any sense of space. The lyrics offer brief glimpses into a fucked up world without enough detail to paint a full picture: “Grenades surround ledge / PTSD particles.” Sharif’s voice is disturbingly loopy, occasionally heightening like he’s taken a sip of helium – almost like he’s getting high off the dark shit he’s spitting. It’s the worst kind of apocalypse, where fear rots into indiscriminate glee. <br></br>Listen <a href="https://fatboisharif.bandcamp.com/album/preaching-in-havana"><u>here</u></a>`,

    content: `A latecomer to the style of Midwest Emo, The Newfound Interest In Connecticut dropped their first and only full length, <em>Tell Me About The Long Dark Path Home,</em> well after the likes of The Dashboard Confessional and later period Jimmy Eat World had changed the scene’s landscape. Somewhere between the Appleseed Cast, American Football, and I Hate Myself, TNIIC were eager to explore the boundaries of the genre in a way similar bands from the 90’s were unequipped to. There are hints of everything from Slint, to Godspeed You Black Emperor, to The Microphones buried in this unwieldy and hard to categorize album. Released in 2005, this album was too early to catch the wave of the late aughts emo revival, but thanks to a reissue campaign a few years ago the album has finally found its audience.`,

But reach a certain age and a souvenir can become unpleasant.

Blake Babies, formed in 1986, was Juliana Hatfield's first project and is a damn promising one. Sitting somewhere between The Sundays, Tulula Gosh, and The Nerves, Blake Babies’ disaffected and saccharine brand of power pop cater to a similar itch as The Real Kids or Shoes, yet their name rarely enters the conversation. Sunburn is an album worth your time, but the album opener “I’m Not Your Mother” might be the best of the bunch. The song is driven by a sort of playful competitiveness as Hatfield jabs at a would-be lover for being unable to function outside of a relationship “Girls will do it all without the aid of a mother/ Anything you can do I can do better” With it’s propulsive rhythm section and some creative hooks, “I’m Not Your Mother” deserves a spot on your playlist this winter.`,

    content: `When I listen to shoegaze I want to mope but feel awestruck at the same time. The love song “Shine” by Bailterspace does this perfectly, in typical fashion for the band: holding the same fuzzed-out guitar chord while letting little melodies play around it. This forms a stuck-in-love drone, pleasant but peals of celestial synth belie a nervousness further explained by the song’s lyrics. “Think I might stop/Hanging round with you.” The line is so casual it’s crushing.

    content: `<em>You can find the audio version of this interview <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/plasticstyledotnet/an-interview-with-shots/"><u>here.</u></a></em><br></br>Recently I got the chance to talk with Shots, a three member group composed of twins Matt and John Friberg along with Daniel DiMaggio. Their music can best be described as a collection of quiet sounds created with a wide range of instruments, tools and toys. Their latest record is 2019’s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/13878250-Shots-Private-Hate"><u><em>Private Hate</em></u></a>.<br></br><custom id="shots-pic"></custom><em>Q: How did Shots form?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>Daniel used to work at The Princeton Record Exchange, and Matt and I were in high school and used to go in there after class. And so we eventually realized that we like the same kind of music because Daniel was working at the register and we would be like, “Have you heard this?” Then Daniel would be like, “Yeah, it's sick” or something. That happened like 20 times and we just became friends from there. And then we started playing music together a little bit.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, we played together in 2007 a couple of times.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>Did we record any of that?<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I have a four track tape of it. John's like told me to listen to it so many times. I should listen to it.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>John and I played a one off show with our friend Dave like ten years ago, it sounded similar to Shots. It was really quiet. We played outside.<br></br><em><b>Q:</b></em><b> </b><em>Did Shots start out with a similar sound to how it is now, or did that take a while to develop?</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>Similar in the sense that a lot of the equipment we used was the same. But maybe it evolved a little bit and changed. I feel like it was more frenetic before, but it could be that again.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I think I use more toys and stuff now.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>Same.<br></br><b>John: </b>For me it was acoustic for all the early stuff. I’d play guitar.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Remember the first time you played bass?<br></br><b>John: </b>Oh, yeah.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>That was like the first time I feel like we played.<br></br><b>John: </b>Yeah, that was crazy. I wonder how that would sound now, too.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>What happened the first time you played bass?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>I think it was, like, melodic, right?<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, it was more normal. And I was playing the piano. This was not that long ago. I would consider it the first Shots thing. So we’ve played continuously since then. It was definitely pretty different, but I don't really remember what it sounded like.<br></br><b>John: </b>I think we played in Daniel’s practice space and it got messed up or something.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I was doing something really wrong, it sounded like it was panned so that both channels were really quiet. I don't know what it could have been at this point.<br></br><b>John: </b>And we also ended up sort of trashing the practice space.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>We kept on fucking up the recording and it ended up being like 6 a.m. before we were done. We were too tired to clean up so we planned to come back the next day. Then I guess another band was using the practice space and got really mad. They thought we just made a mess on purpose. They didn't know it was our gear, I guess.<br></br><b>John: </b>They took pictures of the practice space and sent it around on an email thread for everybody that used the practice space.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>So the first public representation of Shots was a messy practice room.</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>Yeah.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>In terms of the actual sound of Shots, the term “non-music” has been thrown around some. Do you guys find that to be a helpful term, or would you push against that?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>I guess the term can be useful in a sense, as far as a way to describe the sound. When that term started being used, there was us and a few other bands that were included under that umbrella.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>It's not a very accurate term, but it was used at a specific time and described other stuff, all of which sounds like us. So it was useful to describe that. I don’t dislike it.<br></br><b>John: </b>I think there are some shared sensibilities between the people that seem to be included in that. So that's fine too. But it’s obviously just a <a href="https://www.discogs.com/genre/non-music"><u>discogs</u></a> thing.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Oh yeah, it’s used to describe spoken word records and stuff.<br></br><b>John: </b>Yeah. And field recordings and all kinds of stuff. But it's definitely not like the same kind of non-music.<br></br><b>John: </b>I don't know if people still use it.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I haven't really heard it used as much, but maybe I'm out of the loop.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Why the name Shots?</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>I think it was the name of a <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/891935-Steve-Lacy-Shots"><u>Steve Lacy</u></a> record, right?<br></br><b>John: </b>I think that was actually a coincidence.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>Some of the stuff is named after hardcore songs.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah most of the other stuff is.<br></br><b>John: </b>For me “Shots” can be confusing out of context as a single word. And so I just like that effect.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Are there consistent roles for each person? Or does it depend on the track?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I feel like now at least we all have our individual setups. And it sort of changes, but it's not like we have to switch or do anything different. John has been working on his set up consistently and refining it. I maybe do that less.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I've been trying to get rid of stuff and use my own body as much as possible.<br></br><b>John:</b> Matt contributes psychically in ways that aren't necessarily sound based. Matt's role has evolved from sparse, like percussion or the small toys or whatever into things outside of sound entirely – a lot of movement.<br></br><b>Matt:</b> That's an interesting way to put it, because I was trying to think about what’s influencing me recently. I saw this video by Peter Van Riper called “Walking Dance” and it was just kind of like slow walking meditation, but I feel like there's an energetic difference when it's done in a certain way. And maybe that's what I'm like thinking about when contributing to Shots, just cultivating a certain energy.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>When I listen to Shots, the energy that comes across is very quiet. It makes me focus in and try to listen. When people listen to Shots should it be more attentive listening or could it be used as background music?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>For me it could be either.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I think about a certain kind of paying attention to something that isn't, like, strenuous or hyper-focused, but concentrating in a way that's more relaxed. And that I'm not saying that's how people should listen to the music or anything, but–<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I guess that's what I’m doing when I listen to this kind of music and enjoy it.<br></br><b>John: </b>I don't think we're making stuff to become part of the environment that it's being played in. If you wanted to listen with headphones and that's all you're doing, everything is in the recording so you can do that and it would be appropriate. It's all there on the recording.<br></br><b>Matt:</b> Related to this, a cool part of our shows is when we start and people don't know we started because of what we sound like. So there's a space in between us playing and people not paying attention, and then they notice.<br></br><b>John: </b>That’s one of my favorite parts too.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Do y’all have any specific places in mind when putting tracks together?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I just literally think of the places where they're recorded. On <em>Private Hate</em>, most of the tracks are recorded in different places, some of which are actual field recordings.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>At one point, Daniel, you're literally outside in your car and we're in the apartment.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, my old apartment. And I was playing stuff from my car. It was all audible through the window.<br></br><b>John: </b>I also think about the place where it was recorded. Obviously you're recording one place and listening somewhere else. I'm also aware of actual space, like the space between me and the wall or something. I’m into thinking about the space that exists between me and something else. That could be placement of speakers in different parts of the room, or it can be movement from one place to another, having the mics set up and walking around them.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>For me personally, it's just my basic perception. I just want it to sound like how you experience sound in a room or a building or something. I never play through a PA or anything just to have things in specific locations.<br></br><b>John: </b>I feel like when we play shows we usually don't use the PA.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>John and Daniel are both masters at field recording. Really good at it but they use it in humble ways. So it's not this big grand statement or something when using these recordings, but a lot of that gets incorporated into like live sets and stuff. So spatially, I mean, there's all kinds of different spaces going on at once, you know?<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Are the field recordings planned out in terms of place and time, or are they more spontaneous than that?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>They're usually pretty thought through. I know that I'm going to bring my gear because I want to record something, and usually I have an idea of what it is if I'm going to somebody's house and it's like really deep in the woods or something. Although now that I'm working from home, I'll hear shit outside and I can easily just run out and do it. So that's sort of spontaneous.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I guess any time 
    I'm recording, it's because I'm somewhere where I'm intending to do it. Even though sometimes I'll just have a handheld zoom recorder.<br></br><b>John:</b> I feel like you do more of that.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>But it's not like I carry it around anyway. And I could record stuff on my phone, but I just don't. I try to only do it when I’m intending to.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Do field recordings make you listen to sounds differently or pick up on these weird sounds that are in the background that you wouldn't have otherwise?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I feel like I just do that as a result of listening to this kind of music for so long. For entertainment even. I think it gives me ideas of what to do personally in Shots.<br></br><b>John: </b>Sometimes I hear a situation happening and try to recreate it. It's like Foley recording. Like yogurt and putting, like, this thing in it to make it sound weird.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Let's talk about the live performances and how those are approached and the differences between that and the recordings.</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>For me I think it used to be more improvisation based. But recently I've been mapping out what to do when we perform down to every single little movement and sound.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I do the same stuff that I would do live, but you can't really hear a lot of it on the recording. I think for some of <em>Private Hate</em> I just went to Daniel's apartment and figured out what I was going to use when I got there. Recently when we prepare for shows, I've been making videos and sending them to John and Daniel and I like those on their own.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, those are sick.<br></br><b>John</b>: I like how we've done shows in different combinations. Daniel and I have played a couple of shows together without Matt. Matt has played at least one show where it's just him as Shots. I played a show recently that was just me as Shots.<br></br><b>John: </b>It makes it more sustainable and flexible.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I kind of don't like this aspect, but for the live shows I have to amplify what I'm doing as compared to the recording. But I try to minimize the degree to which I change stuff from recording versus live.<br></br><b>John: </b>Yeah. But I guess when we're live, what's the point if people can't even hear it? Like, what's the point of being there? But there was one time where we didn't really have to worry about that because I dropped an entire table worth of gear. Yeah. That was loud.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>What thought was put into the tracklisting and the journey that Private Hate takes you through?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>It was painstaking putting that album together. Editing gets really intense and lots of time is spent on listening really intently. The order of things on that album was definitely calculated.<br></br><custom id="shots-vid"></custom><br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>I did notice that pretty much all of the tracks, there's some kind of persistent background noise. Are those natural background noises of whatever room or area you were in, or were those added in afterwards to give it a certain atmosphere?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>It's different from track to track. I do know that sometimes I would use a mixer and just turn the mixer up really loud so it makes a hiss. But I think that's only on some things.<br></br><b>John:</b> Well, there's one track that’s a recording of a room, and a preamp is running out of batteries. So the recording flickers and then goes into this weird bad battery sound.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>That's on the last track.<br></br><b>Matt:</b> I feel like there were so many conversations about unintentional background noise on tracks.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>We once recorded so quietly that there was a grounding hum. It was horrible. I remember we tried to salvage it for like the next 24 hours. We didn't go to sleep, just obsessively listening to it, trying to say that a certain part was ok. But it all just sounded terrible.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>It's funny that you pick up on the sound because then it's vindicating. Especially John and Daniel are listening to these things and identifying these hisses or whatever that aren't supposed to be there. I guess it is worth doing that.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I don't think there is ever a case where it's added after the fact.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Which is better, static or silence?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>I would pick static.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I would probably pick silence because I have a ten month old baby and I don't get much.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I guess I pick silence, but static to me has the connotation of radio static, which I don't like.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I think they both suck.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>But then silence is not actually possible.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>There's people that go into rooms where the sound is sucked out of them.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>I'm very curious as to what's next for Shots. And then also if there's any individual projects anyone's working on, they want to talk about, feel free to do that as well.</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>This interview actually comes at an interesting time because I feel like we're potentially going to play some shows coming up. We're kind of getting back into the groove. We're working on booking a few shows.<br></br><b>John:</b> We're going to try to do a couple rounds of maybe two shows at a time in close proximity to each other. I live in Providence now and Matt lives in upstate New York. Daniel is in NYC, so I'd probably try to book a couple of shows around Providence and then maybe a couple of shows in NYC and then maybe somewhere in-between. But we just started trying to figure that out. So hopefully in the next few months we'll play some shows. And then there's like tons of stuff that we have recorded.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>We definitely could put out multiple releases, but we think we all would just want to do new recording stuff before.<br></br><b>John: </b>I feel like now we approach recording a little bit differently. There's hours of us playing together. So it would be cool to put out the old stuff, like a short seven inch. There were talks about that a long time ago and the person who was gonna do it might still want to do it. So I just like the idea of it being a possibility.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>As of two weeks ago, he said he still wanted to do it.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>So is this a unique scenario where you have a huge backlog of recorded stuff, or do you start off each new album with newly recorded stuff?</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>I think we've just recorded a few times and we didn't release anything in that time. But if we release something again soon, we’ll probably just record something new.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Are there any individual projects anyone wants to talk about?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>I just finished something for our friend Ben, who’s starting a label. He does a newsletter, but also a podcast called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/anomiaprod/apod0004-ben-kudler-computer-music-for-dorks-episode-one"><u>Computer Music for Dorks</u></a>. It goes into the history of electronic and computer music and stuff. I think he's going to put out something solo of mine on his new label. I have these sculptures that I want to make, the audio portion of it will be released as just that. But it ties back to the sculpture which is like the main thing. So the release will be one of those.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I have a rock band and I'm playing some shows, but I don't have any releases coming up specifically.<br></br><b>Q: </b>Are you referring to <a href="https://homeblitz.bandcamp.com/"><u>Home Blitz</u></a>?<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah.`,

    content: `Something I find compelling about Faust is the flippancy with which they handle their lengthier compositions. A ten minute experimentation like “No Harm” would be the album centerpiece for a more self-serious group, but Faust defang the concept and deliver another practical joke in the long string of pastiches that comprise their first masterpiece, “So Far.” “No Harm” has a simple enough structure, beginning with a slow orchestral crescendo paired with some modest guitar picking that eventually descends into a 7 minute jam. The nonsensical lyrics “Daddy take the banana/ Tomorrow is Sunday'' are repeated endlessly, delivered with such spite and intensity it almost feels like the group have a bone to pick. Here Faust are at their closest to hard rocking contemporaries Can and Amon Düül II, and the track does feel like a jab at the very concept of this style of progressive rock. Creating their first commercial sounding album after the modest returns from their debut must have come with some baggage, but this frustration is balanced by the fact that Faust are having a damn fun time making it. These two competing impulses - playing with your food and eating it - keep the track feeling alive some 50 years later. Regardless of how Faust felt about the tracks content, they must have known they had struck gold in its execution – the dissonant opening of “No Harm” would be the blueprint for the patchwork style of their next “album” <em>The Faust Tapes.</em>`,

It's the loudest song on the album and one of the few to feature any percussion whatsoever, but it feels less like a climax and more like a long fall. One step into this track and the earth gives way, into cavernous vocals and crunching drums that spell doom. Feels like slow motion falling in a dark cave. A wormlike bass wriggles deep below, eventually sucking up all the sonics until the forest is quiet once again.`,

    content: `“Burnin’ For You” is one of those songs I listen to because the best part takes a healthy scoop out of my noggin’s dopamine pool and hands it to me with a smile (in a sugar cone). It’s really a two-scoop kinda deal - you have that rollicking riff that opens the song, bold as spicy chocolate or something, immediately followed by clear blue harmonies that are giving mint chocolate chip. It’s an odd pairing, the vocals sound ambient and placid, out of place in a lusty rock song. But just like my favorite The Cars song (“Magic”), there’s something spellbinding about the combination. The part only happens twice the whole song, at the very beginning and after the first chorus. At four minutes and thirty seconds long, they could have easily fit it in again but don’t, to my simultaneous chagrin and pleasure. I want to hear the part more but such a popular song could get old quickly; BOC were smart to take the good taste route. The end of the song delivers one final hit with the minty harmonies on the last note, leaving me burnin’ for the track evermore.`,

    content: `I was a first week freshman at UCLA, a willing sheep to any social event with the opportunity to meet fellow strangers in need of life. Our dorm floor had free tickets to a jazz festival so we were herded into a bus that took us downtown to a venue so modest I can’t remember its name but you could see the Hollywood sign from your seat. There were a handful of acts including an experimental orchestra which was pretty cool. But the last act was different. It lifted me out of a jazz-induced sleepy haze and muttered small talk with new friends into a New World, a World where jazz is <em>jazz</em>.<br></br>An old man wearing colorful robes had shuffled on stage. He was dragging a heavy chain and gently shook it as he walked; strapped to his neck was a tenor saxophone. I didn’t know who he was but he carried a Presence that made me sit up straight and lean in – here was a master. Masters have no need for pretense, he made that clear with how he crouched into his horn to emit ragged breaths of beauty that sometimes swelled into screams, sometimes laying his sax to rest to give into the joy of music with that old man, unbridled happiness type of dancing. The biggest surprise came when he traded sax for throat. His warble drifted through the crowd like a warm wave and suddenly I felt more spiritually mature than I had 5 minutes before.<br></br>When he was through I was astonished and had to know his name. He was Pharoah Sanders, of course, a stalwart of spiritual jazz who had for more than 5 decades shaped towers of introspection and universal love with his golden horn. Me, I had been alive for less than half his career so I had to start with the big one, 1969’s <em>Karma</em>.<br></br><em>Karma </em>consists of two songs; the first is Pharoah’s greatest epic, titled after a promise: “The Creator Has A Master Plan.” It’s so celestial and grand-scope, that each section of the song – from the untroubled yodel of Leon Thomas to the rapturous tears of Pharoah’s sax – feels like stages of a life that reached <a href="https://livingalifeofmeaning.com/where-are-you-on-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs"><u>transcendence</u></a>. Back on Earth though my dormmates weren’t too thrilled by the knottier sections of the 30 minute opus so I decided to show them the second song instead, the more mellow “Colors.” It’s a rollicking ocean or a windy forest depending on if you listen to the constant sparkle of the piano or the rustling percussion. A few spins of <em>Karma </em>and my brainfolds were permanently tie-dyed by Pharoah’s otherworldly approach to jazz, and he soon became one of my all-time favorite artists.<br></br>Fast forward five years and I’m sitting by a small creek in a Texas park: Ben and I are waiting for a car problem to be fixed during our road trip from Tennessee to California. I’m listening to Pharoah Sanders’ brand new record with Floating Points and London Philharmonic Orchestra called <em>Promises</em>. I’m crying a bit. It’s a soft affair – the synth’s earnest lilt evokes that same inquisitive feeling as looking up at the stars, Pharoah’s sax is a soft caress delivered with the wisdom of an old man who’s been out to sea more than he can count, and the strings add a tearful touch, light but carrying the world's weight. The whole album flows just like that little stream I was watching, like a delicate microcosm. It feels like a solemn reflection, an apt last album for the Master.<br></br>Pharoah Sanders has left this Earth but he was never fully on it; the spirit that flowed through his lips and into his horn taught me how to float too.`,

    content: `We’re deep into Alex G season now and the fourth single leans heavy into the kumbaya huggy vibes that big indie names like Big Thief have been so keen to wrap themselves in as of late. This isn’t a new look for G and it shouldn’t be a surprise after the album title “God Save the Animals” was announced, but lyrics like “You say one day we should have a baby, well / God help me, I love you, I agree, yeah” still deliver quite the cuddly shock. I guess in some sense this is the ideal arc for an artist, hell for half of them figuring their shit out is why they make music in the first place. “How many more songs am I supposed to write before / I should turn it off and say goodnight?” asks Alex. Who knows, but he’s getting closer.`,

    content: `<a href="https://joyer.bandcamp.com/"><u>Joyer</u></a> is a band of two brothers from New Jersey. They’ve been labeled as slowcore but don’t like to be boxed in. I talked to them at Marsha P. Johnson Park right before a storm rolled in.<br></br><br></br><custom id="joyer-vid"></custom><br></br><br></br><em>Q: How did y’all start playing music together?</em><br></br><b>Shane:</b> We both started playing music at a pretty young age. Our parents were always into listening to music, and our dad played a little bit of guitar, and then we both took music lessons growing up and always wanted to be in bands. Nick was in a couple of other bands, and then we realized that we work really well together and have really similar taste in music, so it made sense starting to play together.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>We both were in band in elementary school, but it took a while for music to take for us. We always liked it, but we both quit a bunch of instruments before we got going.<br></br><em>Q: What’s it like being brothers in a band?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>Being brothers in a band together, It's a lot easier than I think people assume because we get along really well, as opposed to other brothers. I guess people like to point out brother bands that don't work out, but we're very similar so it's not really a problem right now at least.<br></br><b>Shane: </b>It's always nice just having someone else who gets what you're trying to do. So if either of us get stuck in terms of writing stuff like the other one could step in and help. It used to be way easier because we used to always live together. So we could just like always be working on stuff and be able to really dive into any ideas that we get right as we get them. But it's still been working out really well.<br></br><em>Q: Is Joyer a slowcore band?</em> <br></br><b>Shane: </b>So I guess we didn't really start the band with intentions to make slowcore music. But a lot of people when they first started listening to us would compare us to different slowcore bands. I feel like that's kind of how that label started, but I don't know, it's really hard for me to describe the music or put it under a specific genre. But maybe I'm just really bad at that personally.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>It kind of just matches our personality. We're kind of lowkey anyways when we first started recording we couldn't get any dynamics out of our music at all. So I think it came from that because we had like a single USB mic and it just kind of sounded terrible, so you couldn't really tell what was going on. I think that added to our sound.<br></br><em>Q: Any slowcore bands y’all are particularly fond of?</em><br></br><b>Shane: </b>I really like the band Acetone a lot, and I'm pretty inspired by them. I like how mellow and quiet they kind of are throughout all of their songs. But then they weave in these really nice melodic vocal parts. I feel like it's a nice contrast to like the laid back and stripped down instrumentals. That's something I try to do.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>We're pretty inspired by codeine too. I like how they have all these dynamics that I've been trying to put into our music more recently. I think we've been getting slowly heavier and heavier, and that's definitely a big codeine influence because they can get really loud but also get really quiet.<br></br><em>Q: What’s the process like for writing lyrics?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>I think for a lot of our lyrics we try to paint visual images maybe because we always write the instrumentals first. What we're picturing when we're listening to the instrumentals helps us inform our lyrics a bit.<br></br><em>Q: Is there an ideal audience for playing live?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>I'm just happy if people show up and seem to be enjoying it. We both started making music for Joyer without even considering playing shows or anything. We just wanted to make music. So the fact that people want to come out and watch us, it's nice enough.<br></br><b>Shane: </b>I feel like when we first started, not that many people would come out. So when people do, it feels really good and it still definitely feels kind of weird that the little amount of people that care even do care. It's nice and it makes playing a lot of fun.<br></br><em>Q: How does playing live differ from the recordings?</em><br></br><b>Shane: </b>Sometimes we're not really able to recreate everything that's on the recording just because we might use different instruments and layers of different instruments on the recordings that aren't really practical to play with live. But also, I think it's definitely fun to get the opportunity to play the song a different way or rework a song for the live set, just to keep it interesting and make the songs fun to play over and over.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>On the recordings, we play all the instruments, but when we play live, we have to find new people to play with and that always makes it different. We're always rotating and I'll play a different instrument depending on who we have to play with. So that changes things a lot. Sometimes we'll have a drummer who naturally plays louder, so we sound heavier, things like that.<br></br><em>Q: Joyer’s sound has become a bit more experimental on the latest album, ‘Perfect Gray.’ What was the recording process for that like?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>We were just more prepared on that album. Every time we make a new album we know more and are more comfortable with what we're doing. We knew a lot more of what we wanted and learned a lot more about production and things like that. So when we went in, we had these ideas to make this song sound warped or we wanted to play around with this or that. Brad, who records and mixes us, is a genius. So we could just tell them we want something to sound a certain way and he'll work with us to get it, like even better than we thought it would be or what we were imagining.<br></br><b>Shane: </b>For that album we got to record some of the overdubs at home. So that gave us more time to add different layers of things that we might not have had the opportunity to do at the studio.<br></br><em>Q: What’s the best and worst thing about touring?</em><br></br><b>Shane: </b>We only just started doing real serious tours recently, but they've been a lot of fun and it's definitely been an amazing experience. I like traveling a lot, so it's naturally really fun for me. I guess that would be my favorite part is just seeing new places that I've never been to before. But with that there's also like a lot of driving involved. My least favorite part would be getting to go to these places, but not really being able to spend too much time in those places just cause we have to get to the venue and manage all of that.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>Yeah, I agree. My favorite part about touring is seeing new places, and my least favorite part about touring is not getting to see those places for very long because we have to leave and go to another place really fast.<br></br><em>Q: How do the instrumental songs come about?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>Our instrumental songs don't usually come about with the intention of them being instrumental to begin with. We just play around and then we're like, “Sounds good!” Sometimes it's just like we made it so weird and kind of dumb that we don't think there could be vocals over it, but I end up liking them a lot more than I think I do, in retrospect.<br></br><em>Q: How does Joyer differ from slowcore bands in the 90’s?</em><br></br><b>Shane: </b>Recently I've been trying to get out of that a little bit just to try new things out. But I still love the spirit of that genre and those bands. I'll always be inspired by that kind of stuff, but also just in terms of playing live, it's been fun playing faster stuff just cause I guess the crowd seems to get more into it and it's easier to feed off of that.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>I don't necessarily think I want us to sound like the nineties or anything like that. I think a lot of bands that I like are from the nineties, not necessarily even like slowcore, but just indie or rap or electronic music or anything. So maybe it just naturally happens. But yeah I agree that we're slowcore, but I don't think that we always try to write like that or just be this has to be this way because it's slowcore.<br></br><em>Q: What’s next for Joyer?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>We have some shows and we're working on a new album, but it'll probably be a while. Go see Shep Treasure play soon too because they're a friend of the band.<br></br><b>Shane: </b>Yeah, Nick plays in that band, so that's why he's plugging it. All right. Thank you.`,

    content: `YHWH Nailgun is a tightly knit group of four. Zach writes the lyrics and sings the vocals. Jack plays the synth. He also runs the label <a href="https://domanisounds.bandcamp.com/"><u>Domani Sounds</u></a> and plays in the band Threesome. Sam plays the drums. He’s in the band <a href="https://godcaster.bandcamp.com/"><u>Godcaster</u></a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/boscomujo/"><u>BoscoMujo</u></a>, and has a solo project called <a href="https://beheadingsonline.bandcamp.com/album/bent-creature"><u>Beheadings Online</u></a>. Saguiv plays the guitar. Also a member of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bug_fight/?hl=en"><u>Bugfight</u></a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/assassin_of_you.th/?hl=en"><u>Assassin of Youth</u></a>. All four mention YHWH Nailgun as their main project.<br></br><br></br><custom id="yhwh-interview"></custom><br></br><br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>How did the band get together?</em><br></br><b>Sam</b>: We’ve all known each other through music for several years, but YHWH Nailgun started when Zack and I lived together in Philly, and we decided to start a project where I was using Ableton - I was doing just electronic production stuff, and he was doing vocals. And yeah, ultimately we wanted to make it into a band and start using live instruments. We've known Jack for a long time and we hit him up and asked if he would play synth. And then we recorded our EP with Saguiv. He produced the whole thing, and since we were all friends with him and fans of his guitar playing, we had him join the band to play guitar, and the rest is history.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>How did your sparse, pared back sound develop?</em><br></br><b>Saguiv: </b>I guess I can't speak too much about the time before I joined, but at least from &nbsp;an outsider perspective from then and taking in the job for production. It’s a lot of organic sounds, kind of trying to mimic nature as much as you can with rock instruments, so to speak. There's no bass, but I guess the synth is taking over that plus higher register stuff. And then I joined and obviously I didn’t want to redirect the band in another direction, but just kind of reinforce what's already happening and see how we can push forward with the initial idea of where we want to go. So I started doing what Zach was already doing on guitar, he started doing the volume pedal thing and removing all the attack or peak noises. It's all swells. Little by little, we feel more comfortable, like dropping things that were there when we initially formed. Like there's a new song where there's no volume pedal or like Sam is thinking of dropping the metal ring on the drums. We call them the gimmicks. We're very critical about new ideas and very easily shut down ideas - we'll give them a shot, but we'll be like, okay, that sucks. Let's not do that. I'd say like seven, six out of ten ideas we're like, nah. But also very open to when something sounds good, it sounds good and doesn't really matter what it’s like.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>I think we approach practicing and the sound in a way that isn't necessarily industrial, but rather when we would rehearse, we were just like really in the sounds that we could make that wouldn't sound like the instrument necessarily. It’d be creatively directed by Zach's poetic descriptions of sounds like making something sound more lemony or making something sound like a water hose or something like that. I think we just like the sounds rather than trying to be experimental or something.<br></br><b>Sam: </b>I think also as a band, we don't really care that much about melodies. Here and there, there's little fragments of melodies that we try to incorporate. A big thing for us has been trying to use melodies almost like samples, where it's not really like a fully realized contour of a melody. It's just kind of like this little fragment. We’re mostly thinking about rhythm and sounds. Anything else we try to incorporate seems to get cast aside, like dead weight.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>How did the </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs4UyojW5PQ"><u><em>video</em></u></a><em> for “Hawk Violence” come about?</em><br></br><b>Zach:</b> I filmed the TV from the Justin Cage Michael Chandler fight. It's a really great fight. It's such a good fight because they were just trading punches, and both of them have just a crazy chin, and so they're just bleeding, and they just kind of keep hitting each other over and over again. It's such a bizarre, over-the-top, masculine moment and it's situated in the most mundane, like guy culture ever. I guess there was something like that connected to the band.<br></br><b>Sam: </b>Yeah, we appreciate athleticism as a band. And excellence.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>We're all fixated on the body.<br></br><b>Sam:</b> That's true, too.The human body is an interest for sure.<br></br><b>Saguiv:</b> I think the video relates to how when Zach is doing his vocal deliveries, like the other day doing vocal overdubs, we were talking about the kind of the fluidity between the macho delivery and the more feminine delivery. Seeing how such a masculine thing like the fight, you know, people beating each other up can seem really homoerotic where they're hugging each other and borderline kissing. I think the back and forth between hitting each other into that weird, bizarre loving in the ring relates to the moments of violence and fragility in the music.<br></br><b>Zach: </b>There's like there's one shot where Michael Chandler is sitting down and his trainer or whatever they call that is trying to clean him up in between rounds, and he looks like a lamb, like bleeding and and and it's like close up on his face. He has this totally vulnerable look on his face. I guess something like the combination of those things is what attracted me to it.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>How do you decide when a song is a finished product?</em><br></br><b>Jack: </b>In rehearsals, we honestly write really well together, like insanely collaborative. It'll start with a lick or a sound that me, Saguiv or Sam will make, and then we just riff off of that. Definitely being guided by Zack in the practice space, I think. When there's multiple ideas that really make sense together it feels like a roller coaster to get to these ideas, but there's a time when it is finalized and we all kind of are looking at each other like “This is it.” Some practices we've written like two songs. And others, we will take hours and hours to figure out one part.<br></br><b>Saguiv:</b> And then we scratch it.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>Yeah, and then we scratch it.<br></br><b>Saguiv: </b>We'll spend a lot of time with an idea and then if it's not working, it doesn't matter how long we spend on it. We're just like, nah, we’re good. Then for vocals, it's never really done until it's recorded or even maybe after. There is always room for change. You're constantly gauging how it feels.<br></br><b>Jack:</b> We have different roles in each song. Not just musical roles, but someone feels like the leader or something. We're recording an EP right now where compared to the first one, it is very different what our role is in each song.<br></br><b>Sam: </b>There's a good amount of stuff where there's not really any kind of harmonic anything going on as much as just rhythms. And they all just kind of like, interlock in a way that we like, and then we just kind of are like. Okay. That's a song. Yeah, we have a new song. You know.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>There's a confidence to it, though. Nobody is saying “Oh, it doesn't feel full enough”, you know?<br></br><b>Sam: </b>It feels it takes very little to write a song for us, it takes very few moving parts before we feel like we're done with it.<br></br><b>Zach: </b>I think it's collaborative in a really fluid way. There's a lot of really natural push and pull that happens at the same time and everybody is equally engaged in it, which is a really exciting way to write because it just feels natural. We do that with the instrumentals and we just kind of like to play with something and then we talk about it and then we go through it and then eventually we get like an instrumental. And then once the instrumental is done, usually I'm like listening to an iPhone demo or something and I'm just always writing anyway, so I'll just usually just take things that I've already written and figure out a way to make it work. One thing I'm really happy about with the band is that it feels like everybody's kind of doing what they do in the way that they want to do it, and it naturally fits into one whole thing, which is cool.<br></br><b>Jack:</b> It really is like the most basic way to write music. None of us really come into practice or anything with an idea. It's like how anybody would imagine writing a song. It's how we write it where someone like Sam starts playing a beat and then I start playing on top of that. Or Saguiv comes up with something. It's really easy, and we're all really good at knowing what this web of YHWH Nailgun that we've created is. So I think we can kind of push the limits and do our own thing inside of this bubble of this idea that we've created over a long period of time. There's a lot of freedom to it.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Talk more about your interest with the human body</em><br></br><b>Sam: </b>I think our music is heavily rhythmic and full of guttural sounds, and Zach makes a real effort to make his vocal performance very physical. He does a lot of contorting his body and placing himself in weird, unnerving poses live. I think a lot of the lyrics are around this sort of physicality.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>I think when we play live, the fact that Zach isn't holding an instrument we also, if we're lucky or I mean, we normally try to do this, but we play with the lights off and like a spotlight on Zach. To where you can see the three of us. But. It's almost like shining a light on Zach's like, you know, body in a way. It's super vulnerable and intimate, but it also kind of goes along with the same idea of the music video or anything like that.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>There’s a lot of looping figures in your music, how do those come about?</em><br></br><b>Jack: </b>I think the loops come from how we come up with ideas in practice and then we almost loop the ideas and then that just kind of ends up being it. But we also talk about being inspired by techno and electronic music and stuff like that where there is that repetition.<br></br><b>Sam </b>I like to take one idea and just do it over and over and over again. It's in a lot of electronic music, and we all are fans of electronic music. You know, there's a lot of different stuff that I think we're drawing from in that sense, but also it just feels good to just play the same thing over and over again until it's just burning into your skull.<br></br><b>Saguiv:</b> How much you can squeeze out of one idea? Because also we're trying to not create too complicated song structures like the instrumental parts, except the drums are pretty intricate, but the songs are kind of simple, mostly like in 4/4. I don't want it to feel like there's like an A section and a B section of completely divorced ideas, but rather like a more fluid transition from one to the other. There should be kind of a new angle on the same kind of riff rather than presenting a new idea for the B section.`,

It’s a fair warning for the whimsy that spills out from every corner of the record, but it’s still hard to prepare for the sheer amount of charm contained within the standout track “Solaris.” Cheerful trumpets glide at hyperspeed, “Last call for the Milky Way” is announced by lead singer Hiramine Aiko with the high-pitched glee of a child playing make-believe, and rapidfire snare hits provide the rocketpower necessary to propel this bop past the stratosphere. The tune really does zoom by – before you know it weightless dream-pop guitars and joyful beeps in morse-code signify a mission successful as the song glimmers out of sight.`,

    content: `The music of <a href="https://marshallstacks.bandcamp.com/"><u>Marshall Stacks</u></a> envisions a future where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD77JgCFETM"><u>Ashra</u></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfmatjm2NdU"><u>Alice In Chains</u></a> coexist. Ambience meets heavy riffage, kept amiable by an ebb and flow that makes each Marshall Stacks album sound surprisingly natural. I had a chance to sit down with Marshall Stacks, who runs the experimental CDR label <a href="https://www.coolattalounge.com/artists"><u>Coolatta Lounge</u></a> and also makes music under <a href="https://cabanaman.bandcamp.com/"><u>Cabanaman</u></a> and <a href="https://snxxxis.bandcamp.com/"><u>snXXXis</u></a>. We touch upon Cabanaman’s recent EP <em>The Compound</em>, as well as the beauty of guitar solos, realistic Chillout music, and the desert.<br></br><em>Q: What was your musical background growing up, what was the first instrument you picked up?</em><br></br>I guess the first instrument I ever played was in the second grade – I tried playing violin and took lessons but never really got super into it. I don't know if it was the way that music was presented in school or if I just had a shitty teacher or what have you. But I did that for a year or two and it didn't really click but it was fun. I started playing music for real in middle school when around the sixth or seventh grade I started playing drums, which I consider my first real instrument. I got pretty obsessed with playing drums and started a band with my friend that was just us trying to sound like Nirvana or Korn or something with absolutely no musical knowledge or ability. That was the first band I ever had, we were called S.O.S. I think one of our songs was called “Clean Up Your Fucking Room.”<br></br>I think learning drums is a cool foundation to learn other instruments, having that rhythmic background I think is helpful. I remember finally learning how to play this really simple AC/DC beat, I remember that was a huge achievement for me. It took months and months of practice just to get the coordination to be able to do that.<br></br>Then I started wanting to make my own music and not just play drums. A few years after that, I started playing guitar and tried to learn covers, but I think it didn't really click until I realized guitar could just be anything you want it to be. I just started playing for fun and what sounded cool to me, I would play solos along to old disco and funk. From there, I just put in the time to start learning, and I picked up the keyboard too. I got into Philip Glass and the minimalist, kind of weird, Terry Riley keyboard stuff. I tried to make Steve Reich rip off music. I had a shitty Casio keyboard and somewhere along the line, all these different things kind of synthesized into Marshall Stacks and my other projects.<br></br><em>Q: You have two main monikers under which you’ve released music recently: Cabanaman and Marshall Stacks. What’s the musical focus for both of these projects, and do you take a different approach when writing songs for each of them?</em><br></br>I've always made music by just jamming a lot and playing whatever sounds good to me at a given moment, and then from there, I'll see the direction that it takes me in and where that leads me. Once I see where it's headed is when I decide which project it's going to fall under. So it depends. The latest album <em>Marshall Law</em> I'm working on is more rock heavy and there are more songs that I've been coming up with over a long period of time, so that kind of came together in a more traditional songwriting style. But snXXXis was more on the experimental, free improv side of things.<br></br>Cabanaman was inspired by this chill out mix that my friend had a burned CD of when we were hanging out in New Jersey a few summers ago. It was this burned CD that just said “Libra Mix” of this really crazy chill out music. That was one of the sort of inspirations for Cabanaman was to make really out there, lounge chill out music – sort of nineties, Pure Moods inspired but updated to the modern day.<br></br>I didn't want it to be just straight nineties, chill out. I wanted to imagine what chill out music would sound like in the modern era. It's a very different world than the world of the nineties when the original Chillout Lounge music came about. So I was like, “Okay, what does that sound like now?” “What does that mean, given how the world has changed?” It's a very different outlook. There's all these horrifying things happening in the world now. Things are headed in a pretty grim direction – obviously the pandemic and climate change and all these different things. I was just thinking, “What does Chill Out music sound like now updated into this like present day reality that maybe has a more bleak outlook than in the nineties, when people were maybe less aware of an imminent environmental catastrophe?”<br></br><em>Q: One of the elements that makes “The Compound” flow so well is the repeated use of water sounds, most often heard on the interludes between each song, which are named “Mara” I-VI. What is the significance of water for this album, and what does “Mara” mean?</em><br></br>The inspiration for that was imagining a desert oasis or something. I lived in this town in the desert in California while I was recording this album. You would be out there in a very pretty barren landscape, then out of nowhere there would be this really lush oasis, with flowing water and palm trees. I think the structure of the album was imagining the water sounds you experience in an oasis in the interludes, but then the actual tracks are like you've left the oasis and you're back in the surrounding world and the reality of strip malls and highways. I imagine someone traveling or embarking on a journey, where each song is a different place. Once the song ends you get back to the oasis.<br></br>The name Mara comes from the oasis around the town that I was living in, it was called the Oasis of Mara. It was named by the Serrano who first settled the area and it means "the place of little springs and much grass." So that's where the name came from. The oasis was burned down by an arsonist while I was living out there.<br></br>A lot of the structure of the album was similar to the live sets that I play. I usually like to play a set that's just sort of continuous, with seamless transitions from one track to another. I guess the structure of the album is probably derived from that and would start off with more ambient water sounds and then go into the tracks. I've always liked the flow of albums that don't have starts and stops. With playing live it's not like, here's a song and then stop and then there's some banter. I'd rather let the focus be on the music rather than trying to comment on every song I'm playing. Some of my favorite music isn’t all spelled out for you, and lets you go to whatever place in your mind that the music takes you to.<br></br><custom id="cman-pic"></custom><br></br><em>Q: The only thing that accompanied you onstage was your guitar and your laptop. How do you feel performing solo affects your relationship with the audience?</em><br></br>I would love to start playing with a band again. When I first started playing Marshall Staxx shows in Chicago I did have a full band, but it became easier to be able to control all the sounds myself and have it sound specifically how I wanted it to sound. I grew up listening to hard rock and at a certain point I got more into electronic music and footwork and I think that expanded my mind in terms of what a live set could even be.<br></br>I think I got a little bored of the traditional rock setup. It just felt a little like, this is what a band has to sound like. It has to be guitar, bass, drums, maybe keyboard. Getting into electronic music was pretty inspirational to think that music can really be anything you want it to be. There's no limits on it. I wanted to incorporate that idea into the punk and hard rock background that I had and just ask, “Okay, how can we apply this cool futuristic way of making music to metal and heavy music that I grew up listening to?”<br></br>In the eighties, people thought by 2020 music was going to be so futuristic and alien and unimaginable. There's definitely a lot of pretty wild music out there now, but I feel like in terms of rock music, it hasn't really gotten there. I feel like some of my music was inspired by imagining what a band like Blue Oyster Cult or something in the 70’s would have thought rock music was going to sound like in 2022 – like woah, it’s gonna be so crazy and unimaginable and alien and there's going to be all these technological advances. So I wanted my music to keep up with that and keep up with the technological pace that things are at. That was some of the idea behind Marshall Stacks.<br></br><em>Q: Both of your projects make use of guitar solos, but put them in unique contexts, like in the middle of a more ambient electronic section. What does a guitar solo mean to you, what interests you about them?</em><br></br>There is this Carl Craig album, <em>Landcruising</em>, that was pretty inspirational. It's really wild, techno futuristic music, and then at the end of the first track there's this guitar solo that comes in. It blew my mind. I think that really opened me up to think that you could have guitar solos over anything. Growing up in the punk scene, a lot of people were pretty anti-guitar solo. Guitar solos were looked at as a sort of cheesy thing, like you're seeing Aerosmith or whatever in an arena and it's like, okay, here’s the guitar solo. Before that became such a trope, guitar solos were from blues music and early rock and roll. It wasn’t cheesy at all. The solo is a place for the guitarist to kind of just go for it and freely express themselves with no limitations of song structure and to just shred and see where it takes you.
     But by the time I was born it was long past post-post-nu-metal, Guitar Center kind of cliche. Rock music had already become this parody of itself by the time I was even old enough to start playing music.<br></br>I think some of the music I wanted to make was a response to that, acknowledging it's rock music in this post-post-Nickelback reality. Acknowledging that and giving a wink to that. I'm not a revivalist. I'm not trying to act like I'm in the seventies or something because it's not, it's 2022. I wanted to give a wink to the Guitar Center tropes while still getting back to the root of what made guitar solos cool to begin with.<br></br><em>Q: When I saw you perform your Marshall Stacks show, you donned the minimal but effective costume of a white tank top and sunglasses. Do you see the man behind Marshall Stacks as more of a character than Cabanaman?</em><br></br>I wouldn’t say Marshall Stacks is a character per se. Maybe it’s an extension of myself or a way of allowing my imagination to take me where it will, but it was all just sort of a natural thing that emerged over many years of performing live. I think characters are really cool though. Characters help explore your imagination and take yourself to places you might not ordinarily go, under the guise of a pseudonym or something, while being able to explore new realities in this imagined mindset. I've always been drawn to people who, you know, they’re on stage, and there's kind of a character, but it's still just an extension of who they are as a person. It's not totally theatrical. I think when things get too theatrical I check out a little bit. But even like a band like Tad or something – when they’re on stage, they’re just going for it. It's not so much a character, but you can tell, there's kind of a wink in their eyes. They know what they're doing. They’re maybe acting like a rock star dumbass, but you can tell they're actually a pretty intelligent person. They're doing it for the fun of it and to be entertaining. You want to see a spectacle if you're paying money to be at a show. I've never intentionally tried to do any of that, but playing shows over the years sort of led me to where I'm at now.<br></br><em>Q: What’s next for Marshall Stacks and Cabanaman? Any projects on the horizon? Any upcoming projects from other artists you’re excited about?</em><br></br>Yeah, I'm just finishing up the new Marshall Stacks album. <em>Marshall Law </em>is the new Marshall Stacks album, and it's some tracks I've been working on for quite a long time. It should be getting released this summer. That's the main thing that I'm focusing on. All of the tunes from that last live show are from the new album. I'd definitely love to play some more Cabanaman live shows soon too. I’m also about to release a reissue on Coolatta of a tape by my friend Jason Shapiro from Chicago, it’s really wild, catchy, nasty auto-tuned power pop kinda stuff. So lookout for that dropping soon.<br></br>Some other artists I’m psyched on - I’ve been playing on some tracks from my friends’ band The Sufis. I've been playing a little guitar on their stuff, I really dig their tracks, they’re like a psychedelic Bobby Caldwell or something. Keep a lookout for new music from them. My friend Harry, who plays as <a href="https://treatmentforu.bandcamp.com/"><u>Treatment</u></a>, he’s my guy. We've gone on some tours and I played a few solos on some of his tracks, I love his music. It’s sort of like sophisto-pop, New Jack Swing influenced. Shoutout to both of them. Also my friend Draye who played that show with me as <a href="https://mankindxx.bandcamp.com/releases"><u>Mankind</u></a> is super talented and is about to release some new music I’m really excited about.<br></br>Keep your eyes peeled for <em>Marshall Law</em>, the new Stacks album, coming out this summer! It’s been a long time in the making and I’m really psyched to finally get it out there.`,

    author: 'Parker Albert',
    createdAt: 1654284206,
    image: KIRA_THUMBNAIL,
    content: `<custom id="kira-vid"></custom><br></br>Kira McSpice lives in an ineffably charming cabin in Salem, NY. I had the pleasure of sitting down with her outside her home to talk about her recent four album series on the stages of the migraine. The filmed interview can be seen above, or, if you’d prefer, you can read the transcribed version below. Enjoy!<br></br>My name is Kira McSpice. I'm a singer songwriter from South Salem, New York. Over the past four years I've been working on a series called <em>The Migraine in Four Parts</em>. It follows the four stages of the migraine headache, going from <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/prodrome"><u>Prodrome</u></a>, to <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/aura"><u>Aura</u></a>, to <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/attack"><u>Attack</u></a> and finally to <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/attack"><u>Postdrome</u></a>.<br></br><em> <custom id="kira-pic-1"></custom> <br></br>Q: When you started this project, did you already know what you wanted each stage to sound like?</em><br></br>I wanted to put my favorite genres into each phase, and so <em>Aura</em> seemed like the perfect phase for ambient music. Of course the <em>Attack</em> phase had to be heavy and then <em>Prodrome</em> and <em>Postdrome</em> was everything else, like a hodgepodge of pop and folk and singer-songwriter music. I wanted each phase to sound like the symptoms in the migraine, so since <em>Aura</em> is super spacey and has a visual element, I created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPGzWoCrF0"><u>video</u></a> to go along with each song.<br></br><em>Q: Prodrome sounds like there’s something brewing, building up. On “Unchain,” for example, you sing, “Everything inside me knew there was something wrong.” Can you talk about what mood you wanted to set for that album?</em><br></br>During the <em>Prodrome</em> migraine phase there's this feeling of impending doom, so I wanted an anxiety present throughout <em>Prodrome</em> to make the listener feel like something bad was going to happen, and that <em>Attack</em> would eventually happen. I wanted to build tension throughout <em>Prodrome</em>, ending with the title track being this big explosion. It took me a while to sort out the tracklisting to see how much tension I could build. I just had to take some time organizing it and messing around with some of the songs.<br></br><em>Q: What were some things you learned about the stages of the migraine while working on this series?</em><br></br>Learning about the Prodrome was a very interesting thing for me, because not everybody realizes that they're having a Prodrome. Most people feel the Attack or they experience the Aura, the visual disturbances. But the prodrome is this quiet creeping thing - you just feel <em>off</em>. And I thought that was really interesting. Same with Postdrome, most people don't realize there is an after effect that can linger for a week even. Most people will say postdrome is a hangover of the migraine. But you can also feel very euphoric during it, which is why I have songs like “Neve” and “Mirth,” which are hopeful because the series is ending and the migraine is ending, but also because of that euphoria that is present in the symptoms of Postdrome.<br></br>But yeah, of course, there is always going to be a sense of like, “Oh, something's up” in my music because I can't just have it be happy for some reason, you know? I have to make it fucked up. And it is fucked up because the migrane will come back.<br></br><em><div align = "center"> <img height = "300" src= "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uLVjIFcnGNjJPvlx3uXOajdDy6oVDMuE" alt="drive image"/></div><p align = "center"> </p>Q: Do you feel like the migraine stages can relate to other processes in life?</em><br></br>Another big theme in the migraine series is mental illness. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 when the migraine series started and I was writing it. And so a lot of my frustrations with doctors and the stigma surrounding it kind of found its way into the music and became a big theme. It seemed like it fit well with the migraine because it’s cyclical. There’s mania and depression and it always comes back in sort of a cycle and the migraine of course has a cycle where it's eventually going to end and then you'll have another one someday. They're both disorders that you can't see. They're happening in your head, and so no one knows the amount of pain you're going through. They're also not very researched by doctors. There's not a lot of information on them, both mental illness and migraines.<br></br><em>Q: The four album covers of the migraine series are beautiful but starkly different than one another in appearance. How did you plan those out and what were you trying to communicate with them?</em><br></br>So the <em>Prodrome</em> and <em>Postdrome</em> covers are based on the hangman tarot card, which upright represents surrendering control to cycles and surrendering control in general. When it's reversed it means the opposite of that, so you don't want to give in to cycles and you're being stubborn.<br></br><em>Prodrome</em> is the reversed hangman tarot card. I started out the series being too controlling and kind of choking everything and just not really being able to go with the flow of things and not really being able to surrender myself to the cycle. I was really fighting my diagnosis and just fighting everything -- like nature -- I hate the wintertime and it makes me super depressed, and I was fighting that without thinking of how necessary it is to have death in the winter. And it's necessary to feel the depression so that I know how great life can feel. That's why <em>Postdrome</em> ends with the hangman in the correct position, because I've learned that at this point it's okay to surrender control and just kind of give in to the cycle because the bad feelings will end and you'll learn more. You'll become wiser when you surrender that control.<br></br>The album art for <em>Aura</em> was me kind of curled up into a ball, sort of shying away from that. With <em>Attack </em>my hands are bound and I'm being, like, burned by fire. So the migraine or like horrible depression or whatever it is is just happening, and there's nothing I can do.<br></br><em><div align = "center"> <img height = "300" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_cO-i-VKIV7vVGRpqY1m-5txE1qwOCL7" alt="drive image"/></div><br></br>Q: Out of the four projects, "Attack" stands out as the most aggressive, and it is also the only album featuring you screaming. What was it like to let loose like that?</em><br></br>I hadn't sung like that before<em> Attack</em>. That was the first time I had ever screamed. That was a lot of fun to learn how to do that, it felt super cathartic to just shriek feedback, and being able to scream a burden is just so fun to do, but it did take a minute to learn how to do it. I had to watch a lot of YouTube videos about how to scream. I still don't know if I'm doing it right, but I enjoy it!<br></br><em>Q: A big theme of this project is being physically impacted by something you cannot control, do you feel music can have the same effect?</em><br></br>I definitely want to get a reaction out of people when they listen. I do want someone to feel sad when I write a very sad song. I want them to feel that because I was feeling sad. I think it's a very cathartic thing for someone to really be able to listen to something and go into that world and cry if you need to. Or feel that loneliness or feel that depth of sadness. Like “000” on <em>Prodrome</em>. That's like a really sad song where I was feeling really awful one day and wrote that and just sank into it. I would hope that maybe it helps people, but I don't know if something like <em>Attack</em> can help. I hope it can help if you're feeling a burden. To hear someone scream. I guess my hope is that it helps people feel that catharsis and that they're able to kind of sit in that world and say “Yeah I really feel this way!”<br></br><em>Q: How do you feel different after finishing this project, and how do you feel the same?</em><br></br>The four albums have definitely changed me in several ways. I was going to Berklee School of Music for a couple years and left because it just wasn't for me. I wanted to start writing music and figured these four albums could be my schooling in a way, especially if I made them each very different with very different people every time. I thought I would learn a lot and I did. I learned so much about music, about writing songs, about working with different musicians and producers. I learned so fucking much and am so glad that I did it. But I also learned a lot about myself and how I write and how I need music to fill my life spiritually. I need to be able to transmute the feelings and the things that have happened in my life into art. It's like a form of therapy. I think with these four albums, I've realized that is something very important to me. I'm really grateful that I saw it through and finished it.<div align = "center"> <img height = "300" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bsl_sFSByNSDAMkwPdywcmUyLbjca1Ud" alt="drive image"/></div><p align = "center"> Photos By Christian Traver </p>`,

    content: `Anyone who’s ever listened to music knows that golden moment when a song first enters their awareness and immediately becomes the only thing that matters. For a few minutes, the world is drowned out by soundwaves shaped to crash upon the ears like a perfect beach. I felt this elation when I first heard “Breathe In” by Frou Frou, a track about the same world-stopping phenomenon but pertaining to love. “And I'm high enough from all the waiting/To ride a wave on your inhaling'' is the moment singer Imogen Heap reaches love-induced ecstasy, and she takes us along for the ride. The blissful bassline that opens the track is the sound of FOMO, something you’d hear when passing a party you wish you’d been invited to. The lilting, saccharine guitar pulled straight from The Cure on the chorus heralds the moment you walk into the party and everybody cheers because you’re actually awesome and you proceed to have the best night ever. And with that Imogen successfully lures us into fantasy musicland, but there’s a reason it all seems too good to be true. Everything drops out at the bridge when Heap repeats “Is this it?” building tension anxiously until she eventually admits “Yes.” The veil has dropped – take a look at the lyrics and it’s clear Imogen’s infatuation is ill-guided, and likewise the fun little dream that plays in one’s head when this song is heard will <expandableText text="never happen" hiddenText="unless you're incredibly popular at parties"></expandableText>.

    content: `With the lavish reissue of Pavement’s final album <em>Terror Twilight</em> finally released, there is no better time to revisit the project. In truth, it's always been a difficult album for me to connect with despite my all too common fanaticism for the group. Much like the final albums from Hüsker Dü or The Replacements, there is a felt difference between its content and the energy put into the recording. The newly matured songwriting doesn't mesh with a band holding back its loose and sophomoric charm, and the result feels more strung-out than suited-up.<br></br>I do want to stress that this album has some amazing moments.The alternate track listing from producer Nigel Godrich highlights the number of true-blue pop songs on the album by cramming them all into the more immediately accessible b-side. This new order doesn’t do much to improve the albums reputation, and like many retrospectives the constant tinkering might dull the albums magic. However, the uncharacteristically straightforward presentation of these songs does a lot more to clue us in on the state of the band at this time and helps us pick apart this obtuse record more thoroughly.<br></br>The first track of the b-side “Billie” features a mix of DNA between early pavement and what would eventually color the more heartfelt moments of Steven Malkmus’ self-titled solo LP. Lyrically it marries the character study of “Jenny And The Ess-Dog” with the free association of “Serpentine Pad.” Anchored around a prominent acoustic guitar, the song starts off slow enough before transitioning into full jam rock. The track keeps you on your toes without the feeling of annoyance that can often accompany this sort of aesthetic, and is probably a good introduction for those Pavement neophytes out there. I wouldn’t go so far as to claim this is the best track on <em>Terror Twilight</em>, but it caught my attention this time around and certainly deserves more love.

Sure, there’s a ​​<expandableText text="deep Reggae bassline" hiddenText="a nice reminder of post-punk's original roots, and an element many revivalists have discarded in favor of something more stilted and rocky
    "></expandableText> that would make Jah Wobble ~wobble~ with delight and a spindly guitar pulled straight from early contemporaries Siouxsie And The Banshees, but they’re only small actors in the track’s grander narrative. Each band member wrote their own parts to the song without hearing the others’ contributions – a patchwork approach that results in several surprise turns, like when a dense clap sends the track into a paranoid, acoustic lo-fi swamp that’d make a good home for Radiohead. Murphy’s menacing vocals of the past have morphed into something more frightened; his voice swirls untethered as he accepts his fate: “I’ll never see the boys again / Cause I’m off to the funny farm.” “Drink The New Wine” is an anti-anthem, an omen crafted by a band ready to step out of the shadows.`,

For as long as I have been listening to music it seems as if the songs on <em>It’s a Shame About Ray</em>, which recently turned 30,<em> </em>are in a constant state of rediscovery. The strength and timelessness of these songs seem to offhandedly mirror whatever you throw at them, and practically every guitar based pop movement in the last decade has made strides to claim them as a result. The second track off the album, “Confetti”, is today's song of the day purely because it’s the cut off the album most often stuck in my head. Featuring all vibes and little to no substance, this track manages to nail the summery power pop hooks the Lemonheads were so good at without any of the structural baggage some other cuts have. The video is interesting in that low effort - listless band playing to a background b-plot unrelated to the song - kind of 90’s thing.

Their follow-up <em>Chairs Missing </em>eclipses <em>Pink Flag </em>by toying with not only song structure, but <em>mood</em>. An obvious example is “I Feel Mysterious Today,” a lurking, drumless creeper of a track fit for dark alleys. "I Am The Fly" kicks the cosplay up a notch with a character study on the household's most infamous pest – shrill guitars flit around honey-trapped synth, while singer Colin Newman fully inhabits the insect’s role: “I am the fly in the ointment/I can spread more disease than the fleas.” “I Am The Fly” becomes an anthem in its own right despite the repulsive subject matter; the song is a precursor to the seriously taken piss-takes of 90’s ironic indie rock.`,

    content: `“John Henry” is a folk song gone wrong. The track is fashioned from the traditional Scots ballad “Lass of Roch Royal,” with original lyrics that tell the tall tale of the steel driver <a href="https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/the-legend-of-john-henry-talcott-wv.htm"><u>John Henry</u></a> – an American legend who bested a steam drill in a competition at the price of his own life. “John Henry” starts menacingly enough, with a dark drone and an autoharp played nervously. But as singer Marion Coutts plows through the verses, the song’s sanity is chipped away at more and more with loopy percussion, chunks of sparking guitar, and a wiry fiddle desperate to keep grasp of the track’s folksy roots. Coutts finishes the tale with the death of Henry on the mountain, mimicked by the song’s rapid acceleration like the last furious heartbeats of the overworked steel driver, and then the inevitable slowdown and collapse. “John Henry” is able to deconstruct folk song structure while staying true to the oft-told legend behind the lyrics.`,

    content: `My Dad is Dead’s most recognized album <em>Let’s Skip the Details </em>is a notably dark and inhospitable work even within the realm of post punk. As the title suggests, one of the work's main preoccupations is the many ways in which communication can fail us, and how attempts at mutual understanding can further isolate. Album opener “Baby’s Got a Problem” is the greatest statement in this regard. By dancing around the true nature of our subject’s wounds, project frontman Mark Edwards dwells on the intangible ways that past trauma stays with us and affects our future relationships. Heavy stuff. The album is also notable for beefing up the group from a solo project to a full backing band, and the sound benefits greatly from it. <em>Let’s Skip the Details </em>dwells between the abrasive bile of Big Black and the more accessible jangle projects of R.E.M. and Camper Van Beethoven, and as a result, Mark Edwards makes damage sound pretty damn captivating.`,

    content: `Yeule is dejected throughout their second album <em>Glitch Princess</em>. Anxious thoughts manifest as tarnished hyperpop that, as a result of the paralyzing distortion and malfunctioning electronics that cut through the record, doesn’t feel so hyper. One method of escape from this haze is attempted on “Electric” – Nat Ćmiel rises above despondency with a high-pitched wail, but their voice is still coated in digital effects that mask their true self. The most bare song on <em>Glitch Princess</em> is the most affecting: “Don’t Be So Hard On Your Own Beauty” is built by honeyed acoustic strums and two strands of Ćmiel’s voice, more unadorned than anywhere else on the record. Here a friend joins Ćmiel in the dark, lighting a match to guide them back to their lost self-worth. The vocals are mostly one-note, they’re breathless, grueling strides towards something brighter, a journey impossible taken alone: “Fall again, you pick up all my guts/Spilling out, bruised up, bloodied up.” Much of <em>Glitch Princess </em>is spent searching for an oasis, somewhere to rest one’s head. On this track, Yeule finds it. <br></br> Support Yeule on <a href="https://yeule.bandcamp.com/album/glitch-princess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>Bandcamp</u></a>`,

    content: `While not the most storied band in 90’s shoegaze, Catherine Wheel are a heavy music touchstone with a passionate following. Their sound is a unique blend of heavy rock and alternative-pedal-tomfoolery that is only becoming more influential as metal infused shoegaze becomes a bigger movement. For my money, bands like Nothing and DIIV take a lot more from this sound than the usual suspects, MBV and Slowdive. One of Catherine Wheel’s signature songs, “Crank” was almost the title track to their second and most popular album <em>Chrome</em>. One listen and you can hear why, this is easily the most accessible and instantly gratifying cut on the album. “Crank” takes the band's heavier fixations and drapes them over smoldering power pop to create true bliss; the leanness and utility of its composition is something to marvel at.`,

    content: `I would like to continue the thread of yesterday's unnoticed anthem by introducing a track that did find its audience. “Do You Remember The First Time?” remains one of Pulps signature tracks, the second single off of their breakthrough album <em>His ‘n’ Hers</em>. By the time of their success, Jarvis Cocker had been in Pulp for half of his life. A picture is painted of a botched first sexual experience, and the jealousies and desires – both realized and incomplete – that spring from that instance. By looking back on an era of youthful inexperience with world weariness and acidity, “Do You Remember The First Time?” ties off the band's first fifteen years with a ribbon. Regardless of how petulant the subject matter is, though, the track’s soaring and intimate chorus has an unmet verve that sends me into hysterics almost three decades later. Jarvis Cocker would deliver more refined anthems in later albums, but the scrappier package has an underdog appeal that, at least sentimentally, reaches the heights of later achievements.`,

    content: `As I was leafing through the wonderful <a href="https://www.sproutology.co.uk/"><u>Sproutology</u></a> site to conduct research for my upcoming Prefab Sprout article, I stumbled across a little band called Hurrah!. They were the first band to sign to Kitchenware, the label home to Prefab Sprout, and it’s clear the two bands were cut from similar cloths: the lead singer for Hurrah! (Paul Handyside) carries much of the same emotional affect in his voice as Prefab’s singer Paddy McAloon. But Hurrah! never quite saw the success of Prefab Sprout and their material is quite tough to find on online streaming. One song of theirs that I was able to discover is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOybuxbL104"><u>“Let It Be Her”</u></a> from 1989. The track’s built on pretty standard jangle-pop guitars, backed by chugging strums that conjure the same tone as overdone smolder on the album’s cover. But the pre-chorus uses the same bold, ringing chord as one of Prefab Sprout’s most overlooked tracks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVoJDXdDgLU"><u>“The Golden Calf,”</u></a> while chorus is a powerhouse in its own: Handyside wails “Please let it be her” like it’s a rollercoaster, launching the song to new anthemic heights. The anthem never found its audience, but there’s a certain appeal to discovering an obscure track that never quite filled the shoes it wanted to wear.`,

The rather straightforward understated lyrics “Hearing you sigh soft and heavy/ Holding mine 'til you feel ready” give the track time to breathe and work as a complement to the rather driven instrumentation. This is a song showcasing Big Thief as a cohesive rock outfit rather than the more folk inspired Lenker vehicles that can be found across <em>DNWMIBIY</em>, and I am sure will sound great in a festival environment. “Flower of Blood '' is a <em>vibe </em>not a statement, this is a track you want companioning late night drives and special moments.

    content: `Faust-adjacent art pop group Slapp Happy exist in the liminal space between disdain and studied adherence for the pop format. While some of their tracks feel unenthusiastically put together, they never lack craft. Dagmar Krause’s vocals in particular elevate the group’s pretensions into something remarkable. “Dawn” is a personal highlight off of their most recognizable album,<em> Casablanca Moon. </em>The cinematic quality of the arrangement is striking: the horns at the forefront provide this dust-caked western drive, while the nimble guitar roaming in the background provides the surface level sheen of a Bond film. Lyrically we are dropped right in the middle of action, an unspecified chase involving a rather urbane cowboy. While each member had other musical ambitions, they sure did make some wonderful pop songs.`,

The explosion starts with an angsty, distortingly warbling bassdrop; a few seconds of tender, crying in the pillow pianos the eye of the hurricane before it’s all blown to a fuck, my universe is imploding, M83-sized grandness of crashing cymbals and spacefaring synths. Finally we land back in a tear-ridden bed and Zeke’s still plucking away at a despondent bass riff but now with some kind of resolve: “I don't really wanna be someone that gets in your way/But I won't let it slide past my face, what you said yesterday.” The track’s restlessness is bound to cause whiplash, but that’s kind of the point. “Movies For Guys” and <a href="https://dltzk.bandcamp.com/album/frailty-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u><em>Frailty</em></u></a><em></em> as a whole use a heapload of varied electronic textures, rapid tone switches, and a knack for heart on the sleeve cinematics to map out the minutiae of adolescent emotion with remarkable accuracy.`,

    content: `Welcome to the very first interview for plasticstyle.net! I got to sit down with Angel Marcloid of Fire-Toolz to talk about her recent LP <em>Eternal Home</em>, which was one of my favorite albums of last year. It was featured on my year-end list, which you can read here. Also, if you’re a podcast kinda person the interview is on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3thkz7YyXEveLiyLu8MuYe"><u>Spotify</u></a> and <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/plasticstyledotnet/fire-toolz-interview/"><u>Mixcloud</u></a>! OR if you want to watch the full, uncut interview check it out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWTFYfNMmY"><u>YouTube</u></a>!<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>Welcome to the show Angel! Really excited to have you here – when Eternal Home came out it really blew me away. You have had quite a few solo projects but now it seels Fire Toolz have become one of your main focuses. What was the genesis of the fire toolz moniker -- what were your goals for the project, and how did you come up with the name itself?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> It’s hard to find a starting point, because really the starting point is like the big bang and &nbsp;everything just kind of comes after the thing before. I have been playing music forever. I guess I can say that when I started using computers to help me make electronic music is probably when fire toolz started to come more into focus. Because I was playing in bands with guitar, drums, etc. for a long time and then I got really into noise music in the late 2000’s. I was already playing acoustic solo music at the time but the noise stuff really inspired me and made me feel a lot more creative when it came to making solo music. So I was doing a lot more of that with hands on stuff and pedals and electronics of various kinds.The possibilities were truly endless when it came to computers. I was doing a combination of chillwave and trance and ambient music and stuff akin to 80’s pop. But then I was listening to more noise with vocals attached to it. Abstract vocals stuff like Wolf Eyes and Russian Tsarlag which was very folky but avant garde with weird vocals. I started making stuff like that using computers and just put improvised vocals over it. I was using a different moniker but changed the name to Fire-Toolz on the following album and the music started becoming a bit more structured and less nihilistic. That has taken me to where I am today.<br></br><br></br>I love the instant gratification of making music on a computer. It really beats writing a song on a guitar and rehearsing it and practicing for months before maybe playing a show. I can sit in my room for months all day long and not even have them written. The name Fire-Toolz came from an early internet terrorism tool, like mailbombing and pinging IP addresses to slow their connections and fishing tools that would constantly try new passwords until it guessed them – really bad stuff. I didn’t use them much but I was constantly fascinated by those kinds of tools that these young anarchistic programmers would make and release. I remember Fire Tools was for AOL but I added the ‘z’ and ‘-’. Unfortunately the creator struggled with a whole lot of trauma and mental illness and passed away a long time ago. When I started looking into it I felt kind of exploitative and wasn’t sure I still wanted to use this name. You know like the way people are with serial killers where they do terrible things and get propped up as icons? I didn’t want to do that here but I love the 90’s aesthetic, the whole cyberpunk thing; that's why I use it. I think its silly and the music doesn't quite fit as much but I have grown attached to it and love it.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>Yeah I personally love the name. When I hear the name Fire-Toolz it reminds me of the tools you would use to make a fire and I think your music has all these different elements that come together to make something pretty explosive and fiery.</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> There is a company called fire tools in Germany and I am surprised they have never bothered me about the name. When you go on twitter and don't use the underscore you will go to their Twitter. I am sure they know about me because the only three things on the internet with that name at this point are me, the hacking program and that company. I thought it would be cool to have a collaboration, like a fire poker with my logo on it. I might ask them about that someday.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>So one of my favorite things about the Fire-Toolz aesthetic is that most of the vocals are screaming, regardless of the other sounds surrounding you. Was there a moment where you decided that would be the main aesthetic or was that more natural?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> I don't really know why I started doing that – I am a singer. I have sung in a lot of bands, some with harsh vocals. I think it was that I really liked the idea of combining screaming with music you might not hear it over. I really like early emo and screamo. What I really love about those bands is that there will be extremely mellow bits with intense screaming on top of that. Even though my music is more aggressive I just really love that pairing. I am singing a bit more now and I just recorded a track the other day that was only singing. I am starting to branch out a bit more now. But it was just what I needed and wanted to do at the time. I really love bands like Skinny Puppy and bile and the remixed old fear factory tunes that are out there. So I really love screaming with electronic music . It’s also easy, I don’t need to come up with melodies, it's just kind of like static noise that I can put over anything and it’s easy to mix. So there are a lot of reasons. I am sure I am going to keep doing it, though I will start singing a lot more as well.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b><em> That is one of the coolest parts of the project. On “Yearning = Alchemical Fire” you’re screaming in that but it’s a danceable beat. I could imagine it being on in a club. I think in this project which sound more direct with a straightforward song structure. Was that intentional when putting together this album?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> No. I just kind of start with a sound and the songs start to write themselves. So some of them come out a little more pop oriented and some of them come out quite the opposite. I mean I like pop structures, the verse chorus verse chorus kind of thing, I grew up on that. But there's never a moment when I think “I should write a pop song.” I just start messing around with a synth or a noise and it just happens.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>I do think there's a really cool balance between songs that have a more coherent structure versus others that are more amorphous, or songs like “--&gt; ¶rogressive --&gt; ¶ath --&gt;", which are more just like a sound collage. What do you think would be missing if you mashed together an EP of the most straightforward songs?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> Well I've never wanted to do that. I have had that idea proposed to me. When I was talking to my label I was given the idea that I should have some genre oriented EP’s, the metal oriented one the jazz one, etc.. But that's not who I am. That doesn’t reflect anything in my life at all. My life is full of, and seems to require, all these elements fusing together. I am not interested in focusing right now, I am in this mode of anything goes. It's not random, it's not like it's not intentional. The idea might be spontaneous. I might be working on a song and it has a beat and a chorus, and I just decide that I should add a wall of noise here. That's just how it happens. I don't have any interest in organizing things too much. I have this EP <em>I Can't Die</em>, and it has a straight up rock song, like how I wish Rush sounded these days. But I was like OK, I need some balance here. So track two is this weird drone noise thing. I like throwing people off like that. I like to disrupt their experience. You thought you were listening to a prog rock record, well, now you have to listen to 6 minutes of something where you dont know what's going on – you don't know when it's going to kick in and it never does. It’s anarchy in a way. It is just what I do. I might get sick of it one day. I thought I would have by now, but I haven't.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b><em> You’ve talked about how Fire-Toolz being a reflection of yourself, even like a diary. Do you think including these more confusing sections reflects your mental space?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> Absolutely. Life is not a genre. In the course of one day we can go from grief and suicide ideation to pure joy. We can have days where everything goes right or days where everything seems to go wrong. There are unexpected turns constantly. Because Fire-Toolz is a documentation of my spiritual development and psychological evolution it wouldn't make sense to try and make a certain kind of music. Right now I want to become more in touch with who I am and I want to become more integrated into the world in ways that make me feel safe and ways I can help people and help myself. If I want to reflect that in my music, it would be just stupid to stick to one sound.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>The first line on the album - “These rocks absolutely must become jewels by first light tomorrow” feels like this anxiety about getting things completed or working on mental health. You must be really busy completing your music and working with </em><a href="https://www.angelhairaudio.com/"><u><em>Angel Hair Studios</em></u></a><em>. What does that line signify to you?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel: </b>Well, you’re very close. I don’t know, you’re kind of spot on, but it’s not really a statement about getting things done in life. I don't really have a problem with that. I’ve always had a drive and been able to work really hard. It is more like my own refinement and development as a person, working through my trauma and working past things that I get stuck on psychologically. It is sort of this insistence and I guess healing and getting past things. I am really impatient a lot of times because sometimes when I've been working for so long and I still have these troubles and I’m just like - “come on!”. &nbsp;The song <a href="https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/track/where-on-earth-is-my-sacchid-nanda"><u>“Where On EARTH Is My Sacchidānanda?”</u></a> &nbsp;is basically elaborating on that. All the lyrics are kind of this whiny sort of entitled perspective where I am just like - I have done all this work where is my peace where is my healing? I have worked so hard! I demand it now. I am not going to work any longer.<br></br><br></br>But yeah that line reflects an experience in my childhood where I got this thing called a <expandableText text="rock tumbler" hiddenText="I too got a rock tumbler and had a very similar experience to Angel"></expandableText>. I got really excited because the front of the box has these shiny looking jems and I wanted to make them. I set it up and was reading the box and found out it would take weeks. The idea of waiting for that long, it caused me this inner pain. I didn’t want to deal with all this time passing. It seemed very hard. My dad told me this story about when he was in the Navy and was writing my mom letters and they would take weeks to get to her. He would be expressing where he was in the moment but by the time they would get to her he would be in a completely different place. He told me that at the time to sort of console and help me and just say “Look this is how life is, you kind of need to be patient to get the best result.”<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>As the album reaches its second half it becomes a bit more nebulous. There are these bursts of energy around these more amorphous sections. This got me wondering about how you put together the tracklisting, were you trying to take the listeners on a particular journey?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel: </b>Like a lot of things in my music it feels like they happen by themselves or they put themselves together. I guess you could say I feel like a robot or a computer program that is set up by a higher entity. So really with the track order I was just trying to think of a cool order. I kept scooting songs around to find what feels good. One thing that was really intentional was putting the song “Thick_flowy_glowy_sparkly_stingy_pain.mpeg” right next to &nbsp;“Where On EARTH Is My Sacchidānanda?” because I thought it would be really cool to have this section where it is just drums, bass, guitar and making the industrial and glitchy elements take a backseat for a bit.<br></br>So the peaks and valleys are sort of intentional. But believe it or not I didn't just sit there and plan it out. I also had it in mind that this was going on vinyl. I had to make sure these 4 sections are gonna fit on a side of vinyl, so that did play a role. I am not good at concept albums because I am not good at planning something and following through exactly what I planned. I actually hate doing that, it’s very limiting. I want to let life blow my sailboat around.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker: </b><em>So I do like a lot of the song titles, and one of them in particular sounded like a video game title - “Awakening Fantasy™ 2.” I was wondering if you played any video games ofr if that influenced any of Eternal Home.</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> I love videogames but I never play them. I don't really enjoy playing them but I do like watching friends play them. I mostly hate violent video games, but if it's really fantasy or sci-fi I can deal with a little violence. I enjoy Super Mario World and that shit’s violent. I did play Super Mario and Metroid as a kid. Video game music definitely inspires me. I have an SNES and an NES and I want to try and get the games I got as a kid. I am just not into them the way some of my friends are. The word ‘awakening’ in the title is referring to a spiritual awakening of sorts, a psychological breakthrough. The ™ refers to the commercialization of spiritual learning and teachers. I don't really have a problem with that sort of thing because I have bought many of those courses. I love spiritual teachers. But the lyrics are about my idolizing and romanticizing the process of spiritual awakening instead of a more authentic experience. The word fantasy refers to me fantasizing about those breakthroughs. The ‘2’ is there because I have used the title in an earlier project and wanted to use it again.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> So in two different songs these two characters pop up - the scientist and the mystic - on "Umbilical Cord Blood" you talk about them having an “awkward dinner date.” What do they represent to you?<br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> It's a huge theme in my psychological exploration. They refer to an inner child and an inner adult. I am a scientist mystic – you would think these things would be two opposites and they kind of are. My life's journey is integrating them. There are some huge mystics who ignore practicality and logic, and those who are so about logic and science that are black or white thinkers who deny the existence of whatever they can't measure. I very strongly have both of these things always on fire within me- I think they fit together perfectly like yin and yang – but being conditioned by our culture, there’s so much of a war in between them. I’m learning new ways to get them to work together. And if you think about it like inner child and inner adult, the inner adult is the scientist – telling my inner child to stop crying, to get into line – and my inner child needs support and love.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>So I do think there is a kind of virtuosity to this music, some really cool, unique chords. I know you’ve collabed with Adam Neely, who’s all about the music theory. Do you think a lot about theory when writing songs or is it more about what sounds cool?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> Well this is a good example of a scientist mystic type thing. I do love theory, and I love Adam Neely so much, he’s such a sweetheart. I love his YouTube channel, and I wish I knew a fraction of what he knows about theory. But the mystic metaphor comes in because I am just doing what sounds good, weird, or interesting. I would say a portion of my music has theory in mind, I intentionally want to use certain chords that bring up certain feelings in me. I really take a lot of tips from jazz fusion and second wave emo because they put a lot of focus on dissonance. But I’m not like ‘I need to sit down and write something in harmonic minor.’ So I would say it’s mostly based on feeling but knowing some theory is really helpful because I use it to evoke the feeling I’m going for.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>Last question: So obviously the album deals a lot about the concept of home, considering the title itself is Eternal Home. What does the concept of home mean to you, in general?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> Well there’s a lot of different ways you can interpret the word home and they’re all part of the title. If we’re just talking about where we live physically, that type of home has always been so important to me. It’s my home base, it’s where I feel safe and the most inspired. As you can see by my surroundings, it’s like I puked my inner self all over my walls. I have cat posters, brightly colored tapestries everywhere. And for awhile I was really struggling feeling at home and settled because I knew that most of these places I was living were not permanent. I find a lot of comfort in the idea of permanence but there’s no such thing as permanent. So I’ve had to really do a lot of work to settle in and relax in a temporary space. So the reason why the last part of the album is titled ‘home for now’ is because I was talking to a friend of mine who said my space is ‘my home for now.’ That really just struck me because I realized I can relax completely into this space because it is my home <em>for now</em>, and when that changes I can worry about it then. It seems really simple but there was a shift within me when that was able to click.<br></br><br></br>But zooming out to the eternal part, home is really just your existence – that’s where you’re seated, there’s no such thing as not being home. &nbsp;Anytime you feel like you’re not home, it’s an illusion - if you can just get in touch with your inner home, there’s a real sense of comfort and relaxation that can come about. I could go into a bunch of different theologies from spiritual traditions to explain this, but I won’t do that. The idea of home is a very spiritual thing as much as a physical thing for me. I struggled a lot coming up with a title, but one day I was just like “ah that’s it.”<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>Any projects on the horizon you want to shout out?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel: </b>I have a series on YouTube called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5cRRlxdns4&amp;t=37s"><u>“Behind The Muzak,”</u></a> where I answer fans’ questions about my work. I just released an <em>Eternal Home </em>Behind the Muzak episode – I asked people on my Instagram stories to ask me questions about <em>ET </em>&nbsp;and I filmed myself answering all the questions. I also just finished working on a video for “Odd Cat Sanctuary.” I would really love it if people <expandableText text="subscribed" hiddenText="Her videos are top notch! highly recommend"></expandableText> to my YouTube channel, because I have this weird desire to do the Youtuber thing. I also post stuff on Instagram and have a mailing list.`,

    content: `This is a serious problem I’m not joking. Every time I pull out my laptop and try to write (which is definitely every day because I definitely am a very productive individual) I inevitably hear the trademark electronic gurgles that set up Smashing Pumpkins’ second best song “1979.” &nbsp;I may not know how my finger landed on the play button but I certainly can’t prevent it once it starts -- the slicked-down mid-90’s indie rock strums are so very irresistible. I blame Ben for issuing an ultimatum at the record store I work at: he would either leave or I would play Corgin’s spiritual successor to Sonic Youth’s “Teenage Riot.” It’d been bouncin’ around the ol’ brain for the past few days as a result of its baffling inclusion on <expandableText text="my work's" hiddenText="Not the record store but the BBQ joint I work at - it's New York I have three jobs"></expandableText> “60’s And 70’s Popular Rock” playlist, so I had no problem relenting to Ben’s demand.<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></br>The Pumpkins’ ode to fading youth soundtracked my life nonstop for the following week, but that was only the beginning. Before long my addiction extended to all of the tracks on <em>Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> — I played "Tonight, Tonight" about twenty times to dramatize my trips to the laundromat, and I couldn’t stop binging the record’s unimpeachable row of ballads that populate the second half. How am I supposed to write when I could instead succumb to the sweet drawl of “Lily My One and Only” or get swept up in the psychedelic tide of “Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans?”<br></br><br></br>I let myself get captured by the siren songs of <em>Melon Collie</em> because I like to follow the implicit advice of “1979” and enjoy the rush while it lasts. When you come across an album you just can't peel your ears away from, lean into it. Because after all, one day we'll all turn to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aeETEoNfOg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dust</a> I guess.`,
