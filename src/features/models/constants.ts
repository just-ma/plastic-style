    content: `Welcome to the very first interview for plasticstyle.net! I got to sit down with Angel Marcloid of Fire-Toolz to talk about her recent LP <em>Eternal Home</em>, which was one of my favorite albums of last year. It was featured on my year-end list, which you can read here. Also, if you’re a podcast kinda person the interview is on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3thkz7YyXEveLiyLu8MuYe"><u>Spotify</u></a> and <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/plasticstyledotnet/fire-toolz-interview/"><u>Mixcloud</u></a>! OR if you want to watch the full, uncut interview check it out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWTFYfNMmY"><u>YouTube</u></a>!\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>Welcome to the show Angel! Really excited to have you here – when Eternal Home came out it really blew me away. You have had quite a few solo projects but now it seels Fire Toolz have become one of your main focuses. What was the genesis of the fire toolz moniker -- what were your goals for the project, and how did you come up with the name itself?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> It’s hard to find a starting point, because really the starting point is like the big bang and &nbsp;everything just kind of comes after the thing before. I have been playing music forever. I guess I can say that when I started using computers to help me make electronic music is probably when fire toolz started to come more into focus. Because I was playing in bands with guitar, drums, etc. for a long time and then I got really into noise music in the late 2000’s. I was already playing acoustic solo music at the time but the noise stuff really inspired me and made me feel a lot more creative when it came to making solo music. So I was doing a lot more of that with hands on stuff and pedals and electronics of various kinds.The possibilities were truly endless when it came to computers. I was doing a combination of chillwave and trance and ambient music and stuff akin to 80’s pop. But then I was listening to more noise with vocals attached to it. Abstract vocals stuff like Wolf Eyes and Russian Tsarlag which was very folky but avant garde with weird vocals. I started making stuff like that using computers and just put improvised vocals over it. I was using a different moniker but changed the name to Fire-Toolz on the following album and the music started becoming a bit more structured and less nihilistic. That has taken me to where I am today.\n\nI love the instant gratification of making music on a computer. It really beats writing a song on a guitar and rehearsing it and practicing for months before maybe playing a show. I can sit in my room for months all day long and not even have them written. The name Fire-Toolz came from an early internet terrorism tool, like mailbombing and pinging IP addresses to slow their connections and fishing tools that would constantly try new passwords until it guessed them – really bad stuff. I didn’t use them much but I was constantly fascinated by those kinds of tools that these young anarchistic programmers would make and release. I remember Fire Tools was for AOL but I added the ‘z’ and ‘-’. Unfortunately the creator struggled with a whole lot of trauma and mental illness and passed away a long time ago. When I started looking into it I felt kind of exploitative and wasn’t sure I still wanted to use this name. You know like the way people are with serial killers where they do terrible things and get propped up as icons? I didn’t want to do that here but I love the 90’s aesthetic, the whole cyberpunk thing; that's why I use it. I think its silly and the music doesn't quite fit as much but I have grown attached to it and love it.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>Yeah I personally love the name. When I hear the name Fire-Toolz it reminds me of the tools you would use to make a fire and I think your music has all these different elements that come together to make something pretty explosive and fiery.</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> There is a company called fire tools in Germany and I am surprised they have never bothered me about the name. When you go on twitter and don't use the underscore you will go to their Twitter. I am sure they know about me because the only three things on the internet with that name at this point are me, the hacking program and that company. I thought it would be cool to have a collaboration, like a fire poker with my logo on it. I might ask them about that someday.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>So one of my favorite things about the Fire-Toolz aesthetic is that most of the vocals are screaming, regardless of the other sounds surrounding you. Was there a moment where you decided that would be the main aesthetic or was that more natural?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> I don't really know why I started doing that – I am a singer. I have sung in a lot of bands, some with harsh vocals. I think it was that I really liked the idea of combining screaming with music you might not hear it over. I really like early emo and screamo. What I really love about those bands is that there will be extremely mellow bits with intense screaming on top of that. Even though my music is more aggressive I just really love that pairing. I am singing a bit more now and I just recorded a track the other day that was only singing. I am starting to branch out a bit more now. But it was just what I needed and wanted to do at the time. I really love bands like Skinny Puppy and bile and the remixed old fear factory tunes that are out there. So I really love screaming with electronic music . It’s also easy, I don’t need to come up with melodies, it's just kind of like static noise that I can put over anything and it’s easy to mix. So there are a lot of reasons. I am sure I am going to keep doing it, though I will start singing a lot more as well.\n\n<b>Parker:</b><em> That is one of the coolest parts of the project. On “Yearning = Alchemical Fire” you’re screaming in that but it’s a danceable beat. I could imagine it being on in a club. I think in this project which sound more direct with a straightforward song structure. Was that intentional when putting together this album?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> No. I just kind of start with a sound and the songs start to write themselves. So some of them come out a little more pop oriented and some of them come out quite the opposite. I mean I like pop structures, the verse chorus verse chorus kind of thing, I grew up on that. But there's never a moment when I think “I should write a pop song.” I just start messing around with a synth or a noise and it just happens.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>I do think there's a really cool balance between songs that have a more coherent structure versus others that are more amorphous, or songs like “--&gt; ¶rogressive --&gt; ¶ath --&gt;", which are more just like a sound collage. What do you think would be missing if you mashed together an EP of the most straightforward songs?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> Well I've never wanted to do that. I have had that idea proposed to me. When I was talking to my label I was given the idea that I should have some genre oriented EP’s, the metal oriented one the jazz one, etc.. But that's not who I am. That doesn’t reflect anything in my life at all. My life is full of, and seems to require, all these elements fusing together. I am not interested in focusing right now, I am in this mode of anything goes. It's not random, it's not like it's not intentional. The idea might be spontaneous. I might be working on a song and it has a beat and a chorus, and I just decide that I should add a wall of noise here. That's just how it happens. I don't have any interest in organizing things too much. I have this EP <em>I Can't Die</em>, and it has a straight up rock song, like how I wish Rush sounded these days. But I was like OK, I need some balance here. So track two is this weird drone noise thing. I like throwing people off like that. I like to disrupt their experience. You thought you were listening to a prog rock record, well, now you have to listen to 6 minutes of something where you dont know what's going on – you don't know when it's going to kick in and it never does. It’s anarchy in a way. It is just what I do. I might get sick of it one day. I thought I would have by now, but I haven't.\n\n<b>Parker:</b><em> You’ve talked about how Fire-Toolz being a reflection of yourself, even like a diary. Do you think including these more confusing sections reflects your mental space?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> Absolutely. Life is not a genre. In the course of one day we can go from grief and suicide ideation to pure joy. We can have days where everything goes right or days where everything seems to go wrong. There are unexpected turns constantly. Because Fire-Toolz is a documentation of my spiritual development and psychological evolution it wouldn't make sense to try and make a certain kind of music. Right now I want to become more in touch with who I am and I want to become more integrated into the world in ways that make me feel safe and ways I can help people and help myself. If I want to reflect that in my music, it would be just stupid to stick to one sound.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>The first line on the album - “These rocks absolutely must become jewels by first light tomorrow” feels like this anxiety about getting things completed or working on mental health. You must be really busy completing your music and working with </em><a href="https://www.angelhairaudio.com/"><u><em>Angel Hair Studios</em></u></a><em>. What does that line signify to you?</em>\n\n<b>Angel: </b>Well, you’re very close. I don’t know, you’re kind of spot on, but it’s not really a statement about getting things done in life. I don't really have a problem with that. I’ve always had a drive and been able to work really hard. It is more like my own refinement and development as a person, working through my trauma and working past things that I get stuck on psychologically. It is sort of this insistence and I guess healing and getting past things. I am really impatient a lot of times because sometimes when I've been working for so long and I still have these troubles and I’m just like - “come on!”. &nbsp;The song <a href="https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/track/where-on-earth-is-my-sacchid-nanda"><u>“Where On EARTH Is My Sacchidānanda?”</u></a> &nbsp;is basically elaborating on that. All the lyrics are kind of this whiny sort of entitled perspective where I am just like - I have done all this work where is my peace where is my healing? I have worked so hard! I demand it now. I am not going to work any longer.\n\nBut yeah that line reflects an experience in my childhood where I got this thing called a <expandableText text="rock tumbler" hiddenText="I too got a rock tumbler and had a very similar experience to Angel"></expandableText>. I got really excited because the front of the box has these shiny looking jems and I wanted to make them. I set it up and was reading the box and found out it would take weeks. The idea of waiting for that long, it caused me this inner pain. I didn’t want to deal with all this time passing. It seemed very hard. My dad told me this story about when he was in the Navy and was writing my mom letters and they would take weeks to get to her. He would be expressing where he was in the moment but by the time they would get to her he would be in a completely different place. He told me that at the time to sort of console and help me and just say “Look this is how life is, you kind of need to be patient to get the best result.”\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>As the album reaches its second half it becomes a bit more nebulous. There are these bursts of energy around these more amorphous sections. This got me wondering about how you put together the tracklisting, were you trying to take the listeners on a particular journey?</em>\n\n<b>Angel: </b>Like a lot of things in my music it feels like they happen by themselves or they put themselves together. I guess you could say I feel like a robot or a computer program that is set up by a higher entity. So really with the track order I was just trying to think of a cool order. I kept scooting songs around to find what feels good. One thing that was really intentional was putting the song “Thick_flowy_glowy_sparkly_stingy_pain.mpeg” right next to &nbsp;“Where On EARTH Is My Sacchidānanda?” because I thought it would be really cool to have this section where it is just drums, bass, guitar and making the industrial and glitchy elements take a backseat for a bit.\nSo the peaks and valleys are sort of intentional. But believe it or not I didn't just sit there and plan it out. I also had it in mind that this was going on vinyl. I had to make sure these 4 sections are gonna fit on a side of vinyl, so that did play a role. I am not good at concept albums because I am not good at planning something and following through exactly what I planned. I actually hate doing that, it’s very limiting. I want to let life blow my sailboat around.\n\n<b>Parker: </b><em>So I do like a lot of the song titles, and one of them in particular sounded like a video game title - “Awakening Fantasy™ 2.” I was wondering if you played any video games ofr if that influenced any of Eternal Home.</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> I love videogames but I never play them. I don't really enjoy playing them but I do like watching friends play them. I mostly hate violent video games, but if it's really fantasy or sci-fi I can deal with a little violence. I enjoy Super Mario World and that shit’s violent. I did play Super Mario and Metroid as a kid. Video game music definitely inspires me. I have an SNES and an NES and I want to try and get the games I got as a kid. I am just not into them the way some of my friends are. The word ‘awakening’ in the title is referring to a spiritual awakening of sorts, a psychological breakthrough. The ™ refers to the commercialization of spiritual learning and teachers. I don't really have a problem with that sort of thing because I have bought many of those courses. I love spiritual teachers. But the lyrics are about my idolizing and romanticizing the process of spiritual awakening instead of a more authentic experience. The word fantasy refers to me fantasizing about those breakthroughs. The ‘2’ is there because I have used the title in an earlier project and wanted to use it again.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> So in two different songs these two characters pop up - the scientist and the mystic - on "Umbilical Cord Blood" you talk about them having an “awkward dinner date.” What do they represent to you?\n\n<b>Angel:</b> It's a huge theme in my psychological exploration. They refer to an inner child and an inner adult. I am a scientist mystic – you would think these things would be two opposites and they kind of are. My life's journey is integrating them. There are some huge mystics who ignore practicality and logic, and those who are so about logic and science that are black or white thinkers who deny the existence of whatever they can't measure. I very strongly have both of these things always on fire within me- I think they fit together perfectly like yin and yang – but being conditioned by our culture, there’s so much of a war in between them. I’m learning new ways to get them to work together. And if you think about it like inner child and inner adult, the inner adult is the scientist – telling my inner child to stop crying, to get into line – and my inner child needs support and love.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>So I do think there is a kind of virtuosity to this music, some really cool, unique chords. I know you’ve collabed with Adam Neely, who’s all about the music theory. Do you think a lot about theory when writing songs or is it more about what sounds cool?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> Well this is a good example of a scientist mystic type thing. I do love theory, and I love Adam Neely so much, he’s such a sweetheart. I love his YouTube channel, and I wish I knew a fraction of what he knows about theory. But the mystic metaphor comes in because I am just doing what sounds good, weird, or interesting. I would say a portion of my music has theory in mind, I intentionally want to use certain chords that bring up certain feelings in me. I really take a lot of tips from jazz fusion and second wave emo because they put a lot of focus on dissonance. But I’m not like ‘I need to sit down and write something in harmonic minor.’ So I would say it’s mostly based on feeling but knowing some theory is really helpful because I use it to evoke the feeling I’m going for.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>Last question: So obviously the album deals a lot about the concept of home, considering the title itself is Eternal Home. What does the concept of home mean to you, in general?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> Well there’s a lot of different ways you can interpret the word home and they’re all part of the title. If we’re just talking about where we live physically, that type of home has always been so important to me. It’s my home base, it’s where I feel safe and the most inspired. As you can see by my surroundings, it’s like I puked my inner self all over my walls. I have cat posters, brightly colored tapestries everywhere. And for awhile I was really struggling feeling at home and settled because I knew that most of these places I was living were not permanent. I find a lot of comfort in the idea of permanence but there’s no such thing as permanent. So I’ve had to really do a lot of work to settle in and relax in a temporary space. So the reason why the last part of the album is titled ‘home for now’ is because I was talking to a friend of mine who said my space is ‘my home for now.’ That really just struck me because I realized I can relax completely into this space because it is my home <em>for now</em>, and when that changes I can worry about it then. It seems really simple but there was a shift within me when that was able to click.\n\nBut zooming out to the eternal part, home is really just your existence – that’s where you’re seated, there’s no such thing as not being home. &nbsp;Anytime you feel like you’re not home, it’s an illusion - if you can just get in touch with your inner home, there’s a real sense of comfort and relaxation that can come about. I could go into a bunch of different theologies from spiritual traditions to explain this, but I won’t do that. The idea of home is a very spiritual thing as much as a physical thing for me. I struggled a lot coming up with a title, but one day I was just like “ah that’s it.”\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>Any projects on the horizon you want to shout out?</em>\n\n<b>Angel: </b>I have a series on YouTube called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5cRRlxdns4&amp;t=37s"><u>“Behind The Muzak,”</u></a> where I answer fans’ questions about my work. I just released an <em>Eternal Home </em>Behind the Muzak episode – I asked people on my Instagram stories to ask me questions about <em>ET </em>&nbsp;and I filmed myself answering all the questions. I also just finished working on a video for “Odd Cat Sanctuary.” I would really love it if people <expandableText text="subscribed" hiddenText="Her videos are top notch! highly recommend"></expandableText> to my YouTube channel, because I have this weird desire to do the Youtuber thing. I also post stuff on Instagram and have a mailing list.`,

    content: `This is a serious problem I’m not joking. Every time I pull out my laptop and try to write (which is definitely every day because I definitely am a very productive individual) I inevitably hear the trademark electronic gurgles that set up Smashing Pumpkins’ second best song “1979.” &nbsp;I may not know how my finger landed on the play button but I certainly can’t prevent it once it starts -- the slicked-down mid-90’s indie rock strums are so very irresistible. I blame Ben for issuing an ultimatum at the record store I work at: he would either leave or I would play Corgin’s spiritual successor to Sonic Youth’s “Teenage Riot.” It’d been bouncin’ around the ol’ brain for the past few days as a result of its baffling inclusion on <expandableText text="my work's" hiddenText="Not the record store but the BBQ joint I work at - it's New York I have three jobs"></expandableText> “60’s And 70’s Popular Rock” playlist, so I had no problem relenting to Ben’s demand.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe Pumpkins’ ode to fading youth soundtracked my life nonstop for the following week, but that was only the beginning. Before long my addiction extended to all of the tracks on <em>Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> — I played "Tonight, Tonight" about twenty times to dramatize my trips to the laundromat, and I couldn’t stop binging the record’s unimpeachable row of ballads that populate the second half. How am I supposed to write when I could instead succumb to the sweet drawl of “Lily My One and Only” or get swept up in the psychedelic tide of “Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans?”\n\nI let myself get captured by the siren songs of <em>Melon Collie</em> because I like to follow the implicit advice of “1979” and enjoy the rush while it lasts. When you come across an album you just can't peel your ears away from, lean into it. Because after all, one day we'll all turn to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aeETEoNfOg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dust</a> I guess.`,
