    content: `Some genres need a champion. As the years roll by the musical styles stack up, and it‚Äôs easy for one to get lost in the mix. Champions come in many forms ‚Äì reissue labels, documentaries, and, most admirably, passionate, devoted collectors. Flemming Dalum is one of the latter.<br></br>In the past 41 years Flemming has collected practically every Italo Disco record known to man, spread his Italo knowledge to the masses, and added his own touch to the genre through countless remixes. I got the chance to ask him a few questions.<br></br><em>Q: When did you first fall in love with Italo Disco?</em><br></br>1982 ‚Äì a friend of mine came home from a holiday in Italy with: Koto ‚Äì ‚ÄúChinese Revenge‚Äù‚Ä¶. When I heard it - boooom - I was blown away and totally hooked on italo.<br></br><custom id = "koto-vid"></custom><br></br><em>Q: In a few words, how would you describe the sound of Italo?</em><br></br>Good question ‚Äì in 1982 I fell in love with the bold attitude of the synth in underground style of italo. ‚Ä¶additional info: around 1982 the Italians also wanted to become famous and music stars‚Ä¶ and the synths was now pretty cheap and available‚Ä¶ The already well known artists made professional productions, but the Italians somehow had much shorter production time, and it seemed the Italians tweaked the synth a bit extra‚Ä¶ which resulted in a kind of bold attitude in the tracks which you didn‚Äôt find in the perfectly balanced/produced commercial hits. So.. If I should describe the sound of italo I would say: <b>Synth driven music from the early 80s made by Italians and released on an Italian record label. </b>If you ask more in general I would include "...with beautiful melodies" <img alt="üòâ" height="17" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/A9c-2HCd8nXN_yTK7-VGSEqoE0_COZNWlALDxLnrjkc5-yaRXUc3pSvkTMj4D-wwHZkuGmBnuVXG6tkvk0PjEo6Sy7_aIhxg4MTKJSEpNUScsoi5Me2GX7pWBKKCasl5pYazGmEhgafD1LNtssOFPx0" width="17"/><br></br><em>Q: What convinced you to make your first trip to Italy?</em><br></br>I had a friend who asked me in 1983 to join him on a trip to Italy - just to buy records ‚Ä¶ please keep in mind it was before decent postorder service‚Ä¶ so my first trip to Italy to buy records was in 1983 (in total I had 11 trips to Italy from 1983 to 1986 - but that's a looong story).<br></br><custom id = "flemming-2-pic"></custom><br></br><em>Q: When did you decide to start remixing Italo tracks in addition to collecting them?</em><br></br>In 2005 I won an international DJ megamix contest, that gave me a lot of fame and attention ‚Äì so records labels and artists started to contact me for edits and remixes‚Ä¶<br></br><em>Q: After decades in the Italo game you can bring a lot of attention to a track ‚Äì do you feel like you have a duty to share/remix obscure tracks you find?</em><br></br>Thanks ... Well I have a huge lifelong passion for italo so I simply love to share my passion and hopefully inspire the new generation with remixes, mixes, edits and unknown discoveries etc‚Ä¶<br></br>In the 00‚Äôs during the first wave of the 23 years italo revival I posted A LOT of mixes with <u>totally unknown</u> italo tracks ‚Äì most of them was NOT to be found on Discogs!!‚Ä¶ That created quite a fuzz and gave me and my mixes huge hype and sooo much attention!!! Collectors went totally crazy to find those records (...and prices went sky high).<br></br><em>Q: Have you ever been commissioned to remix an Italo track that you turned down, simply because it didn‚Äôt need to be remixed?</em><br></br>Over the years I had to slow down my remix activities - so I said no to a lot of remixes‚Ä¶unfortunately‚Ä¶ but it's impossible for me to find time for everything! ‚Ä¶remember I have a fulltime job to take care of‚Ä¶ italo disco is only my sparetime hobby. <em><br></br>Q:</em> <em>And, conversely, are there any tracks that you would love to remix, or just get reissued, that the rightsholders have declined?</em><br></br>No‚Ä¶ well recently I noticed Brian Auger ‚Äì ‚ÄúNighttrain To Nowhere‚Äù was getting a re-issue‚Ä¶ But on a record label I‚Äôm not in contact with - so they didn‚Äôt ask me for a remix‚Ä¶ <img alt="üôÅ" height="17" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PmncFlA6lVjTD0lQeelf04e0yPCy-esWO3uElUD22qdQuGblBJuxmF6MTDB-nt989U556WtdsQSrJQFn39V1HohaVBnBkQeDSkaQOS6ejDR47CPFof9RHwgE_tv0stMO7OI-StCBkFywp8S8WCwO2v0" width="17"/><br></br><custom id = "auger-vid"></custom><br></br><em>Q:</em> <em>Your Instagram is really active and always sharing spicy Italo deep cuts‚Ä¶ How has the online reaction to your work been, and does it affect what records you decide to share or remix?</em><br></br>Ah yes a few years ago... during the lockdown ... I had some extra time and thought I might also get on Instagram. So I started to make one post each day‚Ä¶ When I reached 2000 followers I slowed down to a more easy pace of posting‚Ä¶ Trying hard not to overload the italo fans‚Ä¶ I have great online reactions on both Instagram and Facebook‚Ä¶ very motivating‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs doesn't affect my choice of remixes‚Ä¶ OK once I actually tried to ask on a Discogs forum about wanted future remixes‚Ä¶ And I got many reactions and suggestions‚Ä¶ I actually listened to the fans and now a few of them are released <img alt="üòä" height="17" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/EuY5KjjRYTuFiiMOJoY6cRwCsy9ZT9Rp1yFvN6SEYid6MqTRblVpYINUgN1A57qqB4xt_c0hrkC3HFc0Xhu1Ircoye7Wer-kxvKuPregyDNDSVSzEMocfczgyxrPWIA18YSzcbLWzbMD6fERWkLExls" width="17"/><br></br><em>Q: Do you ever get feedback from the artists of the tracks you remix?</em><br></br>Yes always super good feedback and nice reactions from the artist and record label‚Ä¶ which gives me great motivation.<br></br><em>Q: Where‚Äôs your favorite place outside Italy to discover Italo records?</em><br></br>Germany<br></br><em>Q: How does the attitude of younger Italo-Disco fans differ from those who have been fans since the 80‚Äôs? Do different tracks catch on better with the younger generation?</em><br></br>Yes big difference of which records was popular in the 80s and which are popular now‚Ä¶ In fact also big difference in which records was popular in the 00‚Äôs during the first wave of the italo revival and which records are popular today‚Ä¶ In the 80s I was listening to a lot of italo underground instrumental tracks (B-sides) because the vocals were not always was the best compared to the commercial UK hits‚Ä¶ same style was very trendy in the 00‚Äôs‚Ä¶ but slowly the interest for the vocal tracks raised, especially obscure records ‚Ä¶ now you see much more interest in italo tracks with vocals‚Ä¶ here in the recent years more and more poppy vocal stuff are popular.<br></br><em>Q: Do you feel that modern Italo revival artists and producers are helping the genre or diluting it?</em><br></br>Good question ‚Äì well things change ‚Äì and ‚Äúnothing last forever‚Äù....<br></br>Personally I love to stick very close to the original italo style/vibe (my massive promoting over the last 20 years helped the genre.... which makes me very proud)‚Ä¶ a lot of new italo revival artist and producers take the music in a different direction‚Ä¶ So it‚Äôs actually hard to even call it italo‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more pop or dance ‚Ä¶ and no problems with that, they are fully entitled to do what ever they wanna do‚Ä¶<br></br><em>Q: Do you still visit Italy nowadays?</em><br></br>Yes ‚Äì just normal holidays‚Ä¶ Not searching for records (Remember my italo collection was complete already back in 1986)<br></br><em>Q: Have you ever listened to too much Italo?</em><br></br>Haha is that even possible!? <img alt="üòÇ" height="17" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_301QU5UWgbp1kfeNxgANhsbFK5KJLHA9fZq15DO4L8jbTsPYI1c9j6SJFNgGIq8yf99pzK9Sv6kYDUYaqd1pOlyKZgiwniFcg39SZfiVCDFWRiKwGqTKxZ6-wCjXj0hghGhgNHB-Ig8vJfxo6Tt1Qc" width="17"/> Well I guess I‚Äôve listened soooo much to italo over the last 41 years that it has become a part of my musical DNA.<br></br><custom id = "flemming-3-pic"></custom>`,

    content: `When Plastic Style reached out about putting together an Italo Disco playlist, I think the pitch was a personal top 10 Italo tracks kinda thing. Well, I fucked it up. The first five or six picks were easy, but there are so many equally hot 12‚Äùs from Italy's golden age of dance music that my top 10 became an unranked 10 + an even lengthier ‚ÄúHonorable Mentions‚Äù section. To be clear, this list is highly subjective and in no way gives a complete picture of this era of music. These are purely my personal favorite tracks, and as you‚Äôll see, my tastes lie mostly in the genre‚Äôs early years of ‚Äò82-‚Äô84. After that, the synths evolved and so did the sound, pushing the genre into territory that was thinner sounding and more commercial to my ears. Nevertheless, there are still plenty of quintessential jams in the ‚Äò85-‚Äô87 era of Italo before the genre gave way to the house music sound sweeping Europe. It's up to you to dig them up.<br></br>I‚Äôve compiled a YouTube playlist featuring everything below - 2h 45m worth of golden age Italo bliss. Check it out <a href = "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvkRYqVrmvNEamCJHjPCMzOTT-jm7Mxnh&feature=shared"><u>HERE</u></a>.<br></br>- James Cathcart<br></br><b>Casco - Cybernetic Love (1983)</b><br></br>The rosetta stone for what I look for in an Italo 12‚Äù- fat and bouncy bassline, sounds good at almost any speed you play it, vocals slathered in robotic vocoder, and copious allusions to any combination of: computers, space, lasers, or other garish displays of futurism. Released in Italo‚Äôs greatest year, 1983, on the House of Music imprint, best remembered for releasing this 12‚Äù and BWH‚Äôs Livin‚Äô Up/Stop. Does Italo Disco get better than this?<br></br><custom id = "cybernetic-vid"></custom><br></br><b>Mr. Flagio - Take a Chance (1983)</b><br></br>Incredibly, yes it does. If there‚Äôs a superior Italo release above all others, it‚Äôs Mr. Flagio‚Äôs immortal ‚ÄúTake A Chance‚Äù. An objectively perfect song, made all the more impressive considering its source. The original version of the track is from a year prior by Bill Laswell's Material, and it‚Äôs a snooze. This might be the ultimate example of a cover song trouncing the original. Both Cybernetic Love and Take a Chance were crafted at Studio G Genova by Aldo De Scalzi, clearly a god among men.<br></br><custom id = "flagio-vid"></custom><br></br><b>'Lectric Workers ‚Äì Robot Is Systematic (1982)</b><br></br>Music made by and for robots. Though its bassline isn‚Äôt as in-your-face as the previous two entries, it more than makes up for it with a cacophony of laser sounds accompanied by a chorus of robotic vocals and a woman speaking French for some reason. Prob my favorite release on Disco Magic, Italo‚Äôs biggest label.<br></br><custom id = "lectric-vid"></custom><br></br><b>Steel Mind - Bad Passion (1982)</b><br></br>One of the most infectious, groovy synth basslines of all time. Like a lot of tracks on this list, I first heard Bad Passion on DJ I-F‚Äôs influential ‚ÄúMixed Up In The Hague‚Äù mixes, which played a central role in the resurgence of vintage Italo in the early 00‚Äôs. There, it‚Äôs sped up to a pace more in line with the Italo of the era. I didn‚Äôt realize this until I got the 12‚Äù and heard how slow the original was, yet it still sounded incredible. This one can be played at any speed.<br></br><custom id = "passion-vid"></custom><br></br><b>Some Bizarre - Don‚Äôt be Afraid (1983)</b><br></br>The song is a banger from the outset, but somewhere past the 2-minute mark when the chorus and key change come in, it becomes a religious experience. That‚Äôs what makes this my go-to when it‚Äôs time to pick the energy up on the dancefloor.<br></br><custom id = "afraid-vid"></custom><br></br><b>Govindo ‚Äì Ou Ka Vini Com Moin (1983)</b><br></br>Produced by Mario Baldoni AKA Miro, whose bizarre psychedelic synth-prog track ‚ÄúSafari of Love‚Äù garners a cult status of its own. Here though is his masterpiece, apparently pulled from shelves shortly after release for unknown reasons. This is atypical Italo, sounding like nothing else I‚Äôve heard in the genre. Cooled out and spacy, the sedate female vocal sings a chorus in a language I can‚Äôt identify with any translator. A holy grail 12‚Äù that easily fetches $500+ and for good reason, surely it‚Äôs only a matter of time until Dark Entries does their thing with it.<br></br><custom id = "govindo-vid"></custom><br></br><b>Baby‚Äôs Gang - Challenger (1984)</b><br></br>Baby‚Äôs Gang was meant as a sort of Kidz Bop-style children‚Äôs music project, meant to capitalize on the popularity of Italo Disco. It ended up producing two of the genre‚Äôs best tracks, ‚ÄúHappy Song‚Äù, later turned into an international hit by Boney M, and ‚ÄúChallenger‚Äù, a god-tier banger joyously sung by a chorus of children who dream of traveling to space aboard‚Ä¶.the Challenger. Yes, that Challenger.<br></br><custom id = "challenger-vid"></custom><br></br><b>Fun Fun - Happy Station [Scratch Re-Mix] (1983)</b><br></br>"Scratch versions" were common in the early 80‚Äôs - they were kind of like dub instrumentals but with usually annoying built-in record scratch sound effects. I think they‚Äôre corny, but there‚Äôs something about the scratch for Fun Fun‚Äôs iconic Happy Station that‚Äôs hypnotic. The looped edits of the vocal track, the stop-start drops, the constant changes - this edit really throws in the kitchen sink and comes out sounding completely insane‚Ä¶yet somehow it all works. The original is one of the monsters of the genre, but when I‚Äôm DJing, this is the version I reach for.<br></br><custom id = "happy-vid"></custom><br></br><b>Clay Pedrini - New Dream (1984)</b><br></br>I have to admit that I didn‚Äôt know this one until a couple of years ago hearing my pal Rob play it at one of his excellent "Roboto‚Äôs Gang" Italo nights at Ore Bar in East Williamsburg. I wasn‚Äôt sold at first, the instrumental didn‚Äôt grab me. But the vocal on this one is simply undeniable - by the end of the song I knew it was a major track.<br></br><custom id = "pedrini-vid"></custom><br></br><b>Kano - Another Life (1983)</b><br></br>Here you‚Äôll find one of the biggest, most coked-out synth lines ever committed to vinyl. Pair it with the deeply soulful vocal from Glen White - in some of the only intelligible English in this entire genre - and you have one of Italo‚Äôs most immortal songs, from one of its most prolific, foundational artists.<br></br><custom id = "kano-vid"></custom><br></br><b>HONORABLE MENTION</b><br></br><b>Digital Emption - </b><a href="https://youtu.be/ClLYw2XZodk?feature=shared"><u><b>Go Go Yellow Screen</b></u></a><b> (1983)</b><br></br>What it probably sounds like to live inside a video game.<br></br><b>Pineapples Featuring Douglas Roop ‚Äì </b><a href="https://youtu.be/2pii3uD46OI?feature=shared"><u><b>Come On Closer</b></u></a><b> (1983)</b><br></br>Another soulful vocal in the vein of Kano‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnother Life.‚Äù<br></br><b>My Mine - </b><a href="https://youtu.be/P8aWeV4v6GI?feature=shared"><u><b>Hypnotic Tango</b></u></a><b> (1983)</b><br></br><b>Ken Lazlo - </b><a href="https://youtu.be/Mz6EijdvyFw?feature=shared"><u><b>Hey Hey Guy</b></u></a><b> (1984)</b><br></br>It seems like in the last few years, both of these tracks have crossed over into the general lexicon of the mildly informed Brooklyn DJ - no complaints here. Both are perfect specimens of the genre, with mass appeal. Do you think I‚Äôd complain about hearing these tracks more in public?<br></br><b>Mirage - </b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKErqOWLSVE"><u><b>Woman</b></u></a><b> (1983)</b><br></br><b>Doctor‚Äôs Cat - </b><a href="https://youtu.be/Jy_TBjn_vh8?feature=shared"><u><b>Feel the Drive</b></u></a><b> (1983)</b><br></br>When people refer to ‚Äúfeminist anthems‚Äù they usually mean, like, Beyonc√©,<br></br>When I say it, I mean these songs.<br></br><b>Diana Est - </b><a href="https://youtu.be/_jTJyVK-ztw?feature=shared"><u><b>Tenax</b></u></a><b> (1982)</b><br></br>A bit more lo-fi than some of the other tracks here, this one kind of has a bit of a cold wave feel to it, especially when slowed down a bit.<br></br><b>Fancy - </b><a href="https://youtu.be/x4VxfoG0AKQ?feature=shared"><u><b>Slice me Nice</b></u></a><b> (1984)</b><br></br>How this song has not been in a pizza commercial yet is beyond me.<br></br><b>O‚ÄôGar - </b><a href="https://youtu.be/93e8UWKfpIg?feature=shared"><u><b>Playback Fantasy</b></u></a><b> (1983)</b><br></br>Great track. Even better 12‚Äù artwork and music video. This one‚Äôs very overdue for a reissue.<br></br><b>Gaznevada - </b><a href="https://youtu.be/wgJscwwbhmY?feature=shared"><u><b>I.C. Love Affair [Chinese Version]</b></u></a><b> (1983)</b><br></br><b>Lee Marrow ‚Äì </b><a href="https://youtu.be/NBO_2zxyJoU?feature=shared"><u><b>Shanghai</b></u></a><b> (1985)</b><br></br>A lot of pop culture of the early 80‚Äôs had what you might call a ‚Äúproblematic Asian fetish‚Äù thing going on, and Italo was no exception. Shanghai even uses the ridiculous ‚ÄúOriental riff‚Äù, like from old cartoons. If you can get past that though, both these tracks absolutely slap.<br></br><b>Klein &amp; MBO - </b><a href="https://youtu.be/LtP64JIZR8U?feature=shared"><u><b>De-Ja-Vu</b></u></a><b> (1982)</b><br></br>Klein &amp; MBO is the brainchild of two of Italo‚Äôs most important producers, Tony Carrasco and Mario Boncaldo, notably neither of whom is named Klein or MBO. They‚Äôre also one of the only Italo Disco projects to release a full album, De-Ja-Vu, and the entire thing is a classic. So rather than try to pair it down to just one track, I‚Äôve put the full album at the end of the playlist. But don‚Äôt stop there, the single mixes have some of their best work and are all worth tracking down.`,

    content: `<em>Meshi Kuuna!</em> is the only proper studio LP from Osaka‚Äôs INU to be released during their short existence. Part of an emerging wave of Kansai punk in the late 70‚Äôs and early 80‚Äôs, <em>Meshi Kuuna! </em>serves as both a high water mark and a great entry point. Zig-zagging from bubbly new wave ‚ÄúTsurutsuru No Tsubo‚Äù, to hypnotic post-punk ‚ÄúDum Dum Dan‚Äù, and even an attempt at balladry ‚ÄúYume No Nakahe‚Äù, this album prioritizes energy above all else. Running at a tight 34 minutes, <em>Meshi-Kuuna! </em>twists and turns in so many unpredictably charming ways that it's hard not to smile the whole way through. This was a record truly ahead of its time.<br></br>Frontman Kou Machida went on to be an acclaimed fiction writer, with his work only just beginning to be translated into english, see <a href="https://inpatientpress.bigcartel.com/product/rip-it-up-by-kou-machidahttps://inpatientpress.bigcartel.com/product/rip-it-up-by-kou-machida"><u>Rip it Up</u></a> for more. <em>Meshi Kuuna! </em>is being reissued on MESH-KEY records, check it out <a href="https://inujapan.bandcamp.com/album/dont-eat-food"><u>here</u></a>.`,

We head to Downtown Music Gallery on my bike. My British friend sits on the back where I usually tie my backpack.

    content: `<code>14:00</code><br></br><code>I‚Äôm sitting at Noel‚Äôs favorite caf√© and watching Ed watch Theme-Black‚Äôs cover of ‚ÄúNervous Energy.‚Äù He‚Äôs holding the cigarette that Noel was smoking before he went inside, that he told Ed not to smoke. There‚Äôs maybe two puffs left of the cigarette. Ed always comes to New York and says he quit smoking, and then I see him in the morning and he says he feels like shit because he smoked too many cigarettes last night.</code><br></br><code>15:00</code><br></br><code>I‚Äôm watching Ed and Noel play speed. I just taught them how to play a few days ago and now we all can‚Äôt stop playing. I‚Äôm drinking water out of these tiny cardboard espresso cups, and I‚Äôve finished my iced unsweetened hojicha latte. I‚Äôm aching to finish the chia pudding thing I ordered an hour and a half ago but it‚Äôs hard. I don‚Äôt like the yuzu jelly so much.</code><br></br><code>16:00</code><br></br><code>It‚Äôs my first Sunday off in a long time and once Ed and Noel leave, I‚Äôm unsure of what to do with myself. The book I‚Äôm reading is one my friend W≈Çadek advised me not to read. It‚Äôs the second novel from a Hungarian author I‚Äôve become obsessed with. Each chapter is one paragraph, drawn out, so long, and the story is bleak and depressing. You shouldn‚Äôt be reading things like that, W≈Çadek told me. </code><code><em>They mess with your head.</em></code><br></br><code>17:00</code><br></br><code>I‚Äôm tapping my feet and looking at the map when I see that the venue the show is at is only a ten minute walk from where I am. I call Parker and tell him I‚Äôm close, does he or anyone else want pizza. </code><code><em>Do you want wine?</em></code><code> I call him again fifteen minutes later and tell him I‚Äôm getting a Cuban sandwich instead. </code><code><em>Should I get one bottle of wine or two? If you don‚Äôt even have a sip I‚Äôll get one, but if you even have a glass then I‚Äôm getting two.</em></code><br></br><code>18:00</code><br></br><code>Parker told me he‚Äôll drink beer, so I get one bottle of a natural red wine and a tuna sandwich because the sandwich shop has run out of basically everything. The girl at the shop keeps asking me if I‚Äôm sure I want tuna, because </code><code><em>it comes on brioche</em></code><code>. Well, I love brioche.</code><br></br><code>18:15</code><br></br><code>I get to the address Parker sent me and I know I am in the right place because there is a flyer for the show outside. I go upstairs to the top floor. There is a sign on the door that reads shoes off please, and I have flats on with the stupidest socks ever underneath. I enter a long apartment where people are busy setting up various equipment and where there are a bunch of guys. I find Parker and ask him if he wants any wine. He says yes. I start talking about how stupid my socks are, and all of the guys look at my feet. Parker says those are pretty stupid socks.</code><br></br><code>18:30</code><br></br><code>I go back to the wine shop for another bottle of wine, this time Austrian with a horse on the label. The guy working at the wine shop signed me up for rewards, because </code><code><em>you never know when you‚Äôll end up back here</em></code><code>. I put the wine in the fridge upstairs, which is blocked off by an airport tape thing, signifying that this is the bar and only the barmen are allowed behind it. The guy whose apartment it is tells the guy bartending that no one is allowed to go behind the tape under any circumstances, and </code><code><em>if they have their own drink, and want to put it in the fridge, it‚Äôs a no</em></code><code>. I become self-conscious, and after a moment‚Äôs hesitation, ask if he minds if I keep my wine in the fridge. He says yeah, everyone besides you is not allowed. So it‚Äôs me, the bartender‚Äîwho introduces himself to me as Ben although we‚Äôve met at Parker‚Äôs apartment before where he was also bartending‚Äîand the guy who is selling various party favors who are allowed behind the tape.</code><br></br><code>18:45</code><br></br><code>I‚Äôm sitting outside before the beginning of a hard night‚Äôs work and I‚Äôm smoking some hash. Parker comes downstairs to get some coffees, and once he‚Äôs back from the deli I decide I want an iced coffee and ask him to get me one. He goes and comes back, and says they‚Äôre out of iced coffee. Whatever, I‚Äôve already started drinking wine. Parker takes one drag of my hash cigarette and then starts talking about how he hates how weed makes him feel and that he‚Äôs not smoking anymore. The sun is shining really bright and it‚Äôs really hot, and it‚Äôs really a beautiful day outside.</code><br></br><code>19:00</code><br></br><code>I‚Äôm sitting in the blue vestibule of the apartment building where the show is. Parker‚Äôs gone back upstairs to ask if I can sit outside instead, because I‚Äôve been in there for only a few minutes and I feel like I‚Äôm in limbo.</code><br></br><code>19:07</code><br></br><code>When Parker comes back downstairs we rig the door by putting a folded up beer box over the lock hatch so it stays unlocked. I have a list and a pen and a clipboard, which a girl upstairs pointed out that she gave to me to </code><code><em>make things easier</em></code><code>. She also promised that she‚Äôd help me work the door, that it‚Äôs intimidating the first time you do it, that she has </code><code><em>no problem being a bitch and turning people away</em></code><code>. J, whose apartment it is, told me that after we reach capacity I‚Äôll have to start saying no to people, </code><code><em>tell them to go to the bar at the end of the block, hang out there for a while, and come back‚Ä¶ some people will surely have left by the time they return</em></code><code>. Alternatively, </code><code><em>if someone shows up extremely fucked up, it is </code><code>my job</code><code> to tell them sorry, not tonight man</em></code><code>. I try to imagine turning someone away, the exact way I would verbalize this‚Ä¶ John Cale‚Äôs name is highlighted in yellow on the list clipped to the board. The full list of those in yellow‚Äî</code><code><em>VIPs</em></code><code>, let in no matter the capacity or the level of fucked up-ness‚Äîis as follows:</code><br></br><code>Caitlin</code><br></br><code>Adrian +1</code><br></br><code>Brittney</code><br></br><code>Justine</code><br></br><code>Ben +1</code><br></br><code>Draye +1</code><br></br><code>Cody +1</code><br></br><code>Peter +1</code><br></br><code>Morgan</code><br></br><code>Mimi +1</code><br></br><code>Scott +1</code><br></br><code>Jessica +1</code><br></br><code>John Cale +1</code><br></br><code>19:30</code><br></br><code>A guy walks up to me and just stares. I stare back at him. </code><code><em>Hi. Hi. Did you RSVP? No‚Ä¶ </em></code><code>he looks at the folding sign with the flyer for the show pasted to it. </code><code><em>What‚Äôs going on? There‚Äôs a show‚Ä¶ ambient electronic music‚Ä¶ the last act is destroyed Mexican music. Oh okay‚Ä¶ that sounds sick‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll come back then</em></code><code>.</code><br></br><code>A guy and a girl walk up, we greet each other, and the guy tells me his name. It is one of the names in yellow. </code><code><em>You can go right up. Ok‚Ä¶ how many people are up there? </em></code><code>I look at the tallies I‚Äôve started to jot down. </code><code><em>You guys are the third and fourth person here. Oh‚Ä¶ </em></code><code>They go upstairs. I think about how that‚Äôs about the worst thing to say as a door girl who is supposed to entice people to walk through the door.</code><br></br><code>19:34</code><br></br><code>The couple come back down. </code><code><em>We‚Äôll be right back, we‚Äôre just gonna go for a drink.</em></code><br></br><code>20:00</code><br></br><code>Three Hispanic guys walk by me and ask what‚Äôs going on. I tell them there‚Äôs a show. </code><code><em>Are you performing?</em></code><code>‚Ä¶ I think for a second.</code><code><em> Down here, yes. </em></code><code>I told all of my friends to come early, </code><code><em>this is going to be like the Hunger Games</em></code><code>. I text Duncan:</code><br></br><custom id = "brandon-pic"></custom><br></br><code>Finn is the first of my friends to show up with a couple of Pacificos and I‚Äôm so happy to see Finn. The sun is setting and I remember that there‚Äôs an old guy selling mushroom chocolates upstairs. I text Parker:</code><br></br><custom id = "mushy-pic"></custom><br></br><code>21:00</code><br></br><code>Finn‚Äôs gone upstairs and I‚Äôve stopped tallying the number who have come in. I was told I‚Äôd have to stop letting people in after forty, and there‚Äôs already almost twenty tallies. I was wondering before if I‚Äôd be able to hear anything of the show while sitting outside. I ate half a mushroom chocolate, then another half. J comes downstairs and asks if I‚Äôm all good, if I need anything. I say yes, everything‚Äôs fine, and right before the door closes behind him I see my almost empty glass-looking plastic cup. </code><code><em>J, actually, will you please ask Parker to bring me more wine</em></code><code>. He nods his head and goes up.</code><br></br><code>I see Eric crossing the street and I scream and I turn my head and see Duncan and Brandon coming from the other direction.</code><br></br><code>21:30</code><br></br><code>A crush of mine rides past on his bike while I am talking to somebody. My heart skips a beat, and when he reappears and is magically walking up to the door it stops completely. The person I‚Äôm talking with introduces us. </code><code><em>This is Jenna, Jenna, this is ‚Ä¶ </em></code><code>We‚Äôve met, I say</code><code><em>. </em></code><code>He just stares at me, keeps his always-face on which consists of a knowing half-smile then goes inside. My heart is broken. Why does he always act like we have never met? I look at my friends who have coalesced around a tree and Noel is finally here. He‚Äôd texted me</code><br></br><custom id = "noel-pic"></custom><br></br><code>I tell my friends to go upstairs and get a drink. </code><code><em>There‚Äôs also an old guy selling mushroom chocolates. </em></code><code>Of course they refuse to go on their own which strikes me as profoundly endearing and makes me love them even more than I already do, so I ask Parker to cover my post while I go up.<br></br>Brandon, Eric and Duncan follow me but I really have to pee so I run up the stairs two by two. </code><code><em>Jenna‚Äôs stoned</em></code><code>, I hear behind me. </code><code><em>No, I just really have to pee. </em></code><code>I make it to the top landing and there‚Äôs about thirty pairs of shoes in the hallway. Inside the apartment it is potentially 150 degrees, realistically 100. There is smoke, which I proceed to inquire about, and Parker tells me </code><code><em>there‚Äôs a smoke machine</em></code><code>. I‚Äôm unsure if someone is performing at the moment or not. I run to the bathroom; of course there‚Äôs a line. I decide not to stand in the hallway to the bathroom but right outside the door that leads to this hall. The apartment is long long long‚Äîthe longest wall is covered with film reels and right in front of me there is a large projector, the lens of which is covered with a piece of tin foil. I see Brandon, Eric and Duncan milling around. I look at everyone with their shoes off and pull my hair into a ponytail at the back of my head but don‚Äôt tie it. Someone comes out of the bathroom which means that I‚Äôm next. I go into the hallway and am face to face with Linda Manz in a leather jacket slicking her hair back. Her head is bigger than mine, much bigger. I‚Äôve never seen Out of the Blue. I‚Äôm sure Brandon will love this, especially once he‚Äôs in line for the bathroom with no one ahead of him besides for the person who will be currently peeing then. A guy comes out of the bathroom. </code><code><em>Hi. Hi. A little break? What? Taking a break? Oh yeah</em></code><code>. I remember that I‚Äôm the first face everyone saw when they got here. Before I go back downstairs, I buy some more chocolates and get a cup of water with ice from Ben, who is bartending and making a cocktail with creme de violette. Everyone has these light purple drinks in their hands.</code><br></br><code>22:00</code><br></br><code>It is so fucking hot. I wore a cute hat but I had to abandon it at 7PM. None of my friends are upstairs, they are all sitting on the metal frame around the tree a few steps from the door. J told me to tell people to go down to the corner to smoke, </code><code><em>there‚Äôs always people in front of that smoke shop</em></code><code>. I‚Äôm a pussy and don‚Äôt tell anyone anything. Luckily, they all go down there to buy reggie joints or something anyway.</code><br></br><code>My best friend J shows up and when she asks me to bum a cigarette her voice cracks and she starts to cry. I walk us away from everyone else. She‚Äôd told me she was going to go dancing and take molly the previous day talking about that upcoming night, and now she is telling me about how she left the party and she was still rolling and she walked home and when she saw her pitbull she started crying because she feels like she neglects him, and then she texted her boss, her coworkers, me, she feels like she‚Äôs a shitty person. When I woke up to a text from her that morning I was worried‚ÄîI figured she‚Äôd had a bad trip. It‚Äôs just drugs I tell her, </code><code><em>you‚Äôre just coming down</em></code><code>. She nods her head and takes a few long drags of the cigarette, and nods her head. </code><code><em>You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs just drugs</em></code><code>. I say something funny and she cracks a smile and we both start laughing hard. I hug her close and we go back to my post and I see my friend VM losing his balance, walking like an Egyptian. He vomits. I tell Duncan to bring a lot of water, </code><code><em>we‚Äôll be around the corner</em></code><code>. We get around the corner, VM takes his shirt off. A Puerto Rican guy who I saw milling around with his friends at the end of the block comes over to where we‚Äôre standing, by the bus stop. He looks at us and says something which I don‚Äôt catch. I say what and he puts two fingers into his mouth, all the way back to his throat and says get it all out, </code><code><em>he‚Äôs got to get it all out</em></code><code>. I like him, because I like people who are like the mayor of their block. VM throws up again‚Äîhe‚Äôs just gotten back from France. I heard it was hot in France this summer, but New York somehow always comes out on top of the ‚Äòleast favorable conditions‚Äô list. </code><code><em>It‚Äôs so fucking hot. I think this is just a hot flash. </em></code><code>Lucy comes around the corner with water, and I‚Äôm so happy to see her. I invited her to get her and Parker to talk, but she says she has to leave, her friend is </code><code><em>really fucked up</em></code><code>. I tell her I‚Äôll see her tomorrow, </code><code><em>before you leave talk to Parker</em></code><code>. </code><code><em>Where is he? </em></code><code>I remember the state Parker was in last time I saw him, the beads of sweat on his face and the level of giggly as well as the level of spacey. </code><code><em>Probably upstairs, you should go up</em></code><code>.</code><br></br><code>22:30</code><br></br><code>I can‚Äôt stop complaining about how much </code><code><em>I hate milk chocolate</em></code><code>. And I keep wanting to eat the cigarette which is between my fingers. Not only smoke them, it‚Äôs not enough, I want to eat them. Parker comes downstairs and says that it‚Äôs so fucking good upstairs. His shirt is completely soaked through with sweat, I don‚Äôt even notice it at first. I‚Äôm out of wine so I get a purple drink; I feel like I‚Äôm at Starbucks.</code><br></br><code>23:00</code><br></br><code>Brandon and Duncan and Noel and Parker are high now too so everything is more fun. When Brandon says cheers I can‚Äôt stop laughing and really almost squealing. It feels so good to laugh‚Äîit is the only appropriate method to get all the hot air which fills my head out, the hot air which is making my head feel like it is going to explode. I say out loud that I want to eat the cigarette. Duncan understands, we‚Äôve taken mushrooms together before, and I said this exact thing that time. </code><code><em>I don‚Äôt know how to explain this, but I swear I just want to eat it, it looks so crunchy and perfect</em></code><code>. Parker comes downstairs to ask me if everything is good and he replaces me while I go pee. I go to the hallway bathroom, there are two guys ahead of me, they are talking about how cool the apartment is before they notice me. </code><code><em>How is it down there? Oh it‚Äôs great</em></code><code>. On the couch outside the bathroom hallway there are two people smoking a joint and also making out. I thought there was no smoking inside. When it is my turn for the bathroom I go in and almost fall over. I pee, look in the mirror, start to sing, exit the bathroom singing and get some cash from my bag. I go to the old guy again, a bit ashamed. I forget to ask for the dark chocolate chocolates instead of the milk, and I only remember that someone mentioned that there were even dark chocolate ones once I‚Äôm in the stairwell nibbling on the square. I get to the ground floor and there‚Äôs a blonde girl trying to take Parker and me‚Äôs beer box contraption off the door. I go up to her and definitely don‚Äôt say anything but just stare. </code><code><em>I‚Äôm taking this off, I live here. No that‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm working the door, I‚Äôll take it off. When? </em></code><code>I‚Äôm unsure of what time it is. </code><code><em>Errrr, what time is it</em></code><code>? I look at my watch and I‚Äôm still unsure, and look back up at her. </code><code><em>In an hour. </em></code><code>She goes inside.</code><br></br><code>23:30</code><br></br><code>I go upstairs again for water, and as I close the door behind me I see &nbsp;three guys wearing Mexican cowboy outfits walking down the stairs ahead of me. They leave the top landing, go down one floor, and start tugging on the doorknob. I‚Äôm standing talking to someone on the top landing but I can hear them one flight down. By the time I get down there, I am just in time to see the blonde girl who does indeed live here pull the door wide open to greet us four with what seems to be the scariest possible face she could have mustered. </code><code><em>What the fuck?!?!?!?!?! </em></code><code>Her mouth is wide and gaping and crooked and her eyes look like there is a wire connecting the side that we can‚Äôt see, the back side to some sort of electric generator. She‚Äôs sizzling. </code><code><em>Oh so sorry, so sorry</em></code><code>, one of the guys says. She stands there for a minute with her previously blonde hair burning in blue flames over her head and her teeth sharpened into little triangles poking out of her cavern of a mouth before she closes the door. They continue down the stairs, cackling. </code><code><em>Pinche mierda</em></code><code>. They‚Äôre all going step by step with their feet pointing outward, they‚Äôve got boots on. I put my hand over my mouth and keep laughing, they don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm there.</code><br></br><code>23:55</code><br></br><code>My friends are sitting on cardboard boxes and we are taking turns sitting on the chair I was sitting on at the door. Someone sits down on the table which went along with this chair and my clipboard and breaks it. Brandon keeps asking me if it‚Äôs his turn yet, </code><code><em>no it‚Äôs VM‚Äôs, then mine, then yours</em></code><code>. When it is my turn I sit on the chair and am surprised; it feels so good. I get up when it‚Äôs Brandon‚Äôs turn, and when he sits </code><code><em>it feels so good</em></code><code>, and I start to pick up the hoards of trash that have accumulated around the tree. I am having a hard time picking up all of the bottles and keeping them in the bag, they keep falling out, </code><code><em>is there a fucking hole in this bag what the fuck</em></code><code>, everyone is laughing at me, </code><code><em>Jenna, what are you doing</em></code><code>. The blonde girl who has no problem being a bitch‚Äîwho I‚Äôve found out is the wife of one of Parker‚Äôs friends‚Äîand another girl, the girlfriend of another one of Parker‚Äôs friends, come outside and look at me, ask me how things are going. I say they‚Äôre going normally and after looking at  them for what seems like too long I quickly become embarrassed. Not that they say anything, but I‚Äôve read both of their minds, and they‚Äôre both thinking the same exact thing. Besides, even without my telekinesis, I can see what they think in their eyes. I‚Äôm embarrassed but also proud of my sixth sense.</code><br></br><code>00:30</code><br></br><code>Soon it is only VM and I left, because we are both going back to the West Side. I start to break down my work station (chair, clipboard, pen, trash bag) but not before ripping the thing off the door. When we get upstairs there is a green tray going around to all those left standing. J thanks me for all of my hard work, rewarding me with the magic ability to enjoy my cigarette inside. </code><code><em>Can my friend have one too? </em></code><code>It is now 250 degrees, realistically 110. VM and I smoke, I say thank you, </code><code><em>bye</em></code><code>, and I tell VM a secret when we are going down the stairs. I have to or my head will explode. He doesn‚Äôt really care at all. When we are halfway down the block I realize I left my cardigan upstairs. No one buzzes me in, thankfully the first guy I talked to besides Parker when I got here is walking out when I‚Äôm walking in. He is in the group nudo. I run up, sit for a second because it‚Äôs bad luck to forget something and retrieve it without sitting down where you forgot it.</code><br></br><code>01:45</code><br></br><code>After going one stop in the wrong direction, switching to the right side, getting off at Union Square, walking to 7th Avenue, peeing outside the 1 station and saying good night to VM, I am walking west on 14th Street. Between 8th and 9th Ave I see these weird mannequins in this electrical room.</code><br></br><custom id = "mannequin2-pic"></custom><br></br><code>I keep walking and I cross 10th Ave. Little Island is there, and I start to walk south along the West Side Highway. Once I reach the river walk, I hear the cicadas in the grass and tears form in my eyes and I want to cry but I can‚Äôt. My head is too full of hot air. I look at New Jersey. I look at the pegs sticking out of the water, which are called breakwater. I look south and I hear the water lapping against the wall. I feel that kind of lucky that I start to feel sometimes which brings with it the feeling of floating above the ground, and of walking on air.</code><br></br><code>02:05</code><br></br><code>I get back to where I am staying after sitting by the water for a bit, and I am definitely peaking. I am convinced I was born to speak French. The lights are flickering across the Hudson. I scribble in my notebook.</code><br></br><code><b>21 ao√ªt 2023 lundi 02:05</b></code><br></br><code><b>It is an odd thing, when you find yourself, on your own.</b></code><br></br><code><b>All of the lights flicker.</b></code><br></br><code><b>‚Ä¶</b></code><br></br><code><b>At the end of the day, it is always only you.</b></code><br></br><code><b>Na samym ko≈Ñcu, jeste≈õ tylko ty.</b></code><br></br><code><b>A la fin de la jour, c'est seulmente toi.</b></code><br></br><code>I hate the way the pen feels in my hand, the way the ink bleeds out. It makes me dizzy. I have to stop writing. I didn‚Äôt turn any lights on when I came back to the apartment, I‚Äôve been sitting in the dark. There is nothing to turn off when I get up from my looking post and go to bed.</code>`,

    content: `While searching for some new music to listen to, I stumbled upon Slowdive‚Äôs recent batch of singles for their upcoming album, <em>everything is alive</em>, and hesitantly gave them a spin.<br></br>Lead single ‚Äúkisses‚Äù feels like the sort of big tent 2010‚Äôs indie that I would‚Äôve lapped up in middle school, and I mean that in the best of ways. ‚Äòskin in the game‚Äù is propelled with an understated confidence and adds enough flourish to sound different than what they‚Äôve delivered before, and ‚Äúslab‚Äù is just a masterclass as a slow burn.<br></br><custom id = "kisses-vid"></custom><br></br>So now I have to admit I had never really ‚Äúgotten‚Äù Slowdive. I had listened to all the seminal albums, tried to appreciate the gem that is ‚ÄúAlison‚Äù while thinking of all the other songs I would rather be listening to, and made the effort to appreciate the post rock majesty of <em>Pygmalion</em>; all to little success.<br></br>I love shoegaze, but I am also an impatient fool. I like riffs. Catherine Wheel? Sick. Ride? More please. Swervedriver? I‚Äôll take it. But Slowdive? I always found myself switching to something else about halfway through an album.<br></br><custom id = "crank-vid"></custom><br></br>Slowdive were the kind of band I knew I would love and I was just putting it off making the effort, and with my positive reception to these recent singles, it felt like the perfect time to try. I proceeded to download all the Slowdive I could find on my phone and prepared to listen to the good ol‚Äô discography several times over. Here are my takeaways.<br></br>After listening to their discography once, I came away really gelling with 2017‚Äôs self-titled. It is a wonderful album that I definitely would have helped me enjoy the band a lot more if I had not been too busy banging my head against <em>Pygmalion.</em> Full of larger than life moments of pure indie bliss, this is the kind of album that makes a big band headliner status, and makes a small indie act immediately start booking the Brooklyn Steel or whatever. I don't even know how I missed it in the first place, I was probably too busy still listening to that Mount Eerie album and being sad or something.<br></br><custom id = "know-vid"></custom><br></br>On my second time around I began to appreciate The <em>slowdive </em>1990 EP and <em>Just for a Day</em>, which I am gonna lump together here. <em>Just for a Day</em> does not get a ton of love these days, and I find that a bit unfair. It might lack the cohesion of their later albums, but I find ‚ÄúSpanish Air‚Äù into ‚ÄúCelia‚Äôs Dream‚Äù about as strong of an opening as a debut album can have. I tend to drift off gradually after that point, but every once and a while I get pulled right back into loving it, like the wonderful back half of ‚ÄúBallad of Sister Sue‚Äù. ‚ÄúWaves‚Äù is pretty great too. Love those harmonies. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say I‚Äôd enjoy hanging with <em>Just for a Day</em> fans the most out of the bunch.<br></br><custom id = "celia-vid"></custom><br></br>Now the Slowdive EP situation is a bit weird, from my understanding most of the material gets found in their main releases with the exception of a couple, so I only covered the first two. I missed a few B-sides here and there, but if I‚Äôm overlooking a fan favorite song or two please feel free to email me. Anyways, <em>Slowdive </em>is pretty solid. The first track is slightly rowdier than later releases, but Slowdive letting loose is akin to like, the chillest Mission of Burma song. The later two tracks are really what deliver on their mission statement of being the most atmospheric shoegazers around. <em>Morningrise </em>continues this trend into atmosphere and delivers 20 minutes of the best music Slowdive have produced. Listen to this one if you haven't.. I love the production found on both of these, but maybe that's because I was listening to it on youtube. Both EPs are only found tacked on to the end of the deluxe version of <em>Just For a Day </em>on streaming platforms, and I am just not going to listen to them that way. Fix it please.<br></br><custom id = "ep-vid"></custom><br></br>So now I have to talk about <em>Souvlaki</em>. I admit, after two listens to the whole discog‚Äô I was starting to sweat. Admittedly I hadn't been too focused. I was mostly listening to these albums at work or on the train, and my opinions had mostly stayed the same - ‚ÄúMachine Gun‚Äù fucks, "When the Sun Hits" and ‚ÄúDagger‚Äù are pretty good, and my thoughts end there. So I knew I had to change things up. I buckled down, pulled up a lyrics sheet and did my best to just sit there for forty minutes. Luckily for me it all just clicked.<br></br><custom id = "dagger-vid"></custom><br></br>What I think gets overlooked in some of the discussion around <em>Souvlaki</em> is the simple fact that it's a very good collection of songs. That‚Äôs not exactly a revelation I know, but there is a vein in which <em>Souvlaki</em> follows in the footsteps of Big Star‚Äôs debut and <em>Revolver</em>, with the addition of the band picking their songs apart and stretching them all out in front of the listener. I wouldn't go so far as to call that the strongest way to read <em>Souvlaki</em>, there is simply too much room to breathe on tracks like ‚ÄúSing‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSouvlaki Space Station‚Äù for it to just be a pop album, but hey <em>#1 Record </em>&nbsp;had ‚ÄúST 100/6‚Äù, and making that connection finally gave me an entry point to truly enjoy what this record had to offer.<br></br><custom id = "star-vid"></custom><br></br>Pygmalion. I listened to this one the most and struggled to even write a couple of sentences. I realize that until now I had been using the general presence of songs as a crutch, and I really needed to enjoy the carefully textured atmosphere of what is almost a Neil Halstead solo album. The thing is, while listening, I just kept having panic attacks about quitting my job soon or whatever. I was unable to focus on it at all, in fact I liked it better when I wasn‚Äôt trying that hard. I‚Äôll have Parker tie me to a chair and explain it to me one day, but for now I am just going to have to take the L and move on with my life. (‚ÄúCello‚Äù though? I can get behind ‚ÄúCello‚Äù)<br></br><custom id = "cello-vid"></custom><br></br>So I guess my biggest takeaway is if you are gonna appreciate slowdive, you gotta maybe sit down and take a breath first. I hadn‚Äôt been doing that enough anyway. I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite at the moment but uhh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ <em>Just for a Day. </em>It's done, lock it in.<br></br>Definitely gonna listen to the upcoming Slowdive album <em>everything is alive</em>, it started this whole journey in the first place, it's promising to be quite the event. You should all listen to it. Day one even. Out today.<br></br><custom id = "newslow-pic"></custom>`,

    content: `Strange Flesh is the Brooklyn electronic duo of Varrick and Ed Zed. We had a little chat. Read on to learn about their brand new EP <a href="https://strangeflesh.bandcamp.com/album/very"><u>‚ÄôVery,‚Äô</u></a> the origins of their collaboration, and, most importantly, their favorite animals.<br></br><custom id = "very-vid"></custom><br></br>                                              Video by Jonathan Bower<br></br><em>Q: Favorite animal and why?</em><br></br>A fantastic opening gambit, though as it's impossible for either of us to choose just one animal, here's a whole mess o' beasts:<br></br><b>Varrick:</b> I‚Äôm a particular fan of the aye-aye, a strange nocturnal primate with grizzled fur, out-sized eyes and ears, and a boney, elongated middle finger it uses to extract grubs from dead wood (and to pick its own nose, apparently). One of my favorite things about the aye-aye is that its appearance is so very striking that people describing it can‚Äôt help but use subjective language like ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù and ‚Äúgrotesque.‚Äù<br></br><custom id = "ayeaye-pic"></custom><br></br>Similarly from Madagascar, the fossa is a type of giant predatory mongoose that climbs around in trees hunting lemurs and looks like a beautiful, sleek weasel-cat-dog.<br></br><custom id = "fossa-pic"></custom><br></br><b>Ed:</b> I love the lammergeier, or bearded vulture, which breaks apart animal bones by dropping them repeatedly on rocks from a great height, and is able to digest the bony shards owing to its extremely high stomach acidity. The way it makes such great use of its often barren environment with perseverance and dexterity is awesome, in the true sense of that word.<br></br><custom id = "vulture-vid"></custom><br></br>On a fuzzier note, pika‚Äôs are one of our mutual favorites because they look like a cross between bunnies and mice, and squeak very cutely (and very loudly) whilst hopping around on mountain rocks, building their nests out of flowers.<br></br><custom id = "pika-pic"></custom><br></br>The eyeless golden mole 'swims' beneath the surface of desert sand to hunt termites and the like. If that's not a reason to shower praise upon this animal, then seriously, get stuffed.<br></br><custom id = "goldenmole-pic"></custom><br></br>I also find starlings to be some of the most underrated birds on earth. They're beautiful, extremely smart, and expert mimics, which makes sense given that they're related to mynah birds.<br></br><custom id = "starling-pic"></custom><br></br>And cats of course &nbsp;are the best of all, because... CATS.<br></br><em>Q: When did each of you first consider yourself a musician?</em><br></br><b>Varrick:</b> ‚ÄòMusician‚Äô is such a dirty word.<br></br><b>Ed:</b> Probably around the age of eight when I wrote and recorded my first 'proper' song, entitled 'I'm Famous' - a lopsidedly self-aggrandizing tune which featured me singing, drumming on a laundry box and making guitar noises with my mouth. I also straight-up stole a line for it from Ozzy Osbourne's 'Flying High Again'.<br></br><custom id = "famous-song"></custom><br></br><em>Q: What was the first piece of music you two made together?</em><br></br>It was a lolloping, lyrically queasy number called ‚Äú(Me And My Baby Went) Graverobbing,‚Äù which we wrote and recorded via Garageband whilst very drunk one night when we still resided in London. We lived not too far from Highgate Cemetery at the time, and well, you know, necrophiliac fascination is never far from the surface in that kind of tantalizing scenario, is it?<br></br><custom id = "grave-song"></custom><br></br><em>Q: I just realized ‚ÄòVery‚Äô shares phonetic similarities with Varrick‚Ä¶ is there a connection?</em><br></br>We would dearly love to answer yes, but regrettably it‚Äôs a no. Though now that you've planted this deeply appealing seed, perhaps it'll be yes from now on.<br></br><em>Q: What comes first when making a Strange Flesh song - the flesh or bones?</em><br></br>Oh, the bones! Bones, bones every time. We usually start with a skeletal drum beat before injecting some marrow of percussion into it, next we apply voices, then bass, followed by samples and ambient sounds, and at that point maybe we'll allow in the flesh of a melody if it comes a-knockin'. Oftentimes though, we'll tell it to fuck off and it storms away in a cloud of tears.<br></br><em>Q: My favorite track on the EP is ‚ÄúSugoku,‚Äù it‚Äôs very high-octane. How did that track come about?</em><br></br><b>Varrick:</b> We wanted a track for the EP that referenced 'Very' whilst being sonically distinct from it. ‚ÄòSugoku‚Äô uses colloquial counterparts to ‚Äúvery‚Äù in Japanese, though they don‚Äôt have the same sort of languid cynicism that the word ‚Äúvery‚Äù does in the song. It‚Äôs the adverbial form of ‚Äúsugoi,‚Äù which means something like ‚Äúamazing,‚Äù or ‚Äùawesome.‚Äù The other lyric, ‚Äúyabakunai?‚Äù is something like, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt that crazy?‚Äù So it‚Äôs really just emphatic fragments without any underpinning sentence.<br></br><b>Ed:</b> I love bass music in its myriad forms, and the galloping club strains of ‚ÄúSugoku‚Äù were partly inspired by the footwork k-hole I'd found myself in at its inception.Also, the voice as instrument is something I find endlessly compelling, hence all the rhythmic cut-ups and glitches on V‚Äôs vocals later in the song.<br></br><custom id = "sugoku-vid"></custom><br></br><em>Q: There‚Äôs some really creative sampling choices in ‚ÄòVery‚Äô - bubbles popping, fox cries - how do you decide what to sample? Do y‚Äôall have a favorite sample?</em><br></br><b>Varrick: </b>Ooh, that‚Äôs a good question. We do use a lot of samples in our material, from a wide variety of areas. Animal sounds are an endless source of wonder for us, particularly as they're often so strange, special and unique that we don't feel the need to manipulate them at all.<br></br><b>Ed: </b>We're probably happiest when fusing animal calls with everyday mechanical or 'domestic' noises from our immediate environment, and the 'Very' EP is no exception to this, as it features various bird calls alongside the gurgle of our kitchen sink, and the pop of a beer can opening.<br></br>It's impossible to choose a favorite sample though, as there are so many we love so well!<br></br><em>Q: The cat mask in the ‚ÄúCroydon Fox‚Äù music video is awesome. How was it made?</em><br></br><b>Varrick:</b> Painstakingly. It's actually a very cheap lacquered cardboard mask kit that we found in the wilds of the internet. It took us about two weeks to assemble (we had to reinforce it a lot, as it takes quite a beating in the video), and was so loose on Ed's head that he had to wear a furry hood inside it to keep it steady, despite him having hair like Bart Simpson that really ought to have done that job on its own. We filmed the video in late summer, so he almost suffocated during every shoot, but I think you'll agree that his profound suffering was worth it.<br></br><custom id = "flesh-vid"></custom><br></br><em>Q: Varrick, in ‚ÄúCroydon Fox‚Äù you repeatedly assert your ‚Äúfavorite time of day is night.‚Äù Is that true? What about you, Ed?</em><br></br><b>Varrick: </b>Without question, yes. I‚Äôve always been a night owl.<br></br><b>Ed: </b>Yeah, definitely. There are many things I like to experience by day, but I find that the nighttime world is imbued with a sharper, more potent energy.While it‚Äôs a sentiment we both share, we should confess that the line ‚Äúmy favorite time of day is night" in 'Croydon Fox' is actually a sample of Lauren Bacall that we lifted from a daft 70s coffee commercial.<br></br><custom id = "lauren-vid"></custom><br></br><em>Q: The lyrics to ‚ÄúCroydon Fox‚Äù are pretty creepy - what‚Äôs the inspiration for them?</em><br></br>'Croydon Fox' was inspired by the peculiar modern legend of the so-called 'Croydon Cat Killer'. Reports of mutilated cats showing up in the streets of London satellite town Croydon surfaced in the British news a few years ago, quickly blossoming into a fully blown press-fueled moral panic. After much ballyhoo and the wrongful accusation of various locals, the evil nighttime ripper was found to be urban foxes. Our song was written from the perspective of a fox as media-concocted serial killer, as a way to satirize the lunacy of the whole affair.<br></br><custom id = "fox-pic"></custom><br></br><em>Q: Any creepy dreams recently?</em><br></br><b>Ed:</b> I recently dreamed that a child broke into our apartment and threatened Varrick and me at gunpoint. His motives were unclear, but it culminated in me attempting to hold down his wrist as he slowly twisted it around to point the gun at my face. Chillingly, I awoke to find myself pinning my own wrist to the wall behind our bed. Make of that what you will, Freudians.<br></br><b>Varrick: </b>I rarely remember much about my dreams, but that‚Äôs okay because they‚Äôre almost always anxiety dreams. Like, I‚Äôm trying to get to an event I‚Äôm supposed to attend, but I need to use the bathroom first but I can‚Äôt find it and then I do find it and use it but I forget something important there and end up having to go back for it later except now the whole part of the building where it was has crumbled away. The other night, I dreamt that I was sitting on a standard wooden chair like you might find in a classroom or something, and suddenly I realized that the legs had elongated until it was twenty storeys tall, and I had to stay very still or it would topple over. You know ‚Äî happy, healthy dreams.<br></br>Last night I dreamed that I was riding in a car with Ed and my mother and my sister, and explaining the minutiae of the grammar behind ‚Äúsugoku,‚Äù and lamenting that it was all much too boring to put in an interview.<br></br><em>Q: Must every Strange Flesh song be danceable?</em><br></br>Danceability is in the booty of the beholder, baby. We like to think that even at our most spartan and downbeat, there's some beautiful, crazy fucker out there willing to shake their badonkadonk to whatever freak-ass warble we've cooked up.<br></br><em>Q: The samples of ‚ÄòVery‚Äô sound so high fidelity - how do you make them sound so clear and cool?</em><br></br>We bathe every last one ofthem in the silken tears of <expandableText text = "eunuchs" hiddenText = "castrated human males"></expandableText> before committing them to tape. Also, our years of home recording experience - and those of our immensely talented co-producer Arthur - all lend themselves to the aural sheen the world finds so bedazzling.<br></br><em>Q: The two remixes of ‚ÄòVery‚Äô really add extra dimensions to the song. What's the importance of remixes to y‚Äôall? How were the remixers chosen?</em><br></br>Remixes are extremely important to us, and it's vital that any reworking of one of our tracks has its own distinct voice, whether we're doing it ourselves, or if it's in the hands of someone else.<br></br>Arthur Fleischmann aka Digital Equipment Co, is the third member of Strange Flesh, and our longtime co-producer and collaborator. As well as being a production whizz, he's an incredible musician with a great experimental sensibility, so it made absolute sense to unleash his wild energy on 'Very'.<br></br>The other 'Very' version is by the brilliant New Zealand-dwelling musician, DJ, radio host and all-round reggaematical rapscallion, Stinky Jim, who has been a long distance friend and supporter of ours for many moons. Jim recently did us the honor of asking us to remix one of the tracks from his superb last album ‚ÄòSpacial Awareness,‚Äô and in return, he served up the barnstorming 'Very' dub extravaganza you hear on our new EP.<br></br><custom id = "remix-vid"></custom><br></br><em>Q: If Strange Flesh was a venerable monarch and they had just been dealt a fatal wound what would their famous last words be?</em><br></br>"Now there is a vacuum where once there was a ghost."<br></br><em>Q: What's next for Strange Flesh?</em><br></br>A couple of Goldschl√§gers, another single, an album, regret, redemption, death.<br></br><custom id = "flesh3-pic"></custom><br></br>                                                 Photo by Jen Liu`,

The Lark Does Liquesce‚Äù have already guided the listener through the peaks and valleys of GNOM‚Äôs multi-faceted sound. ‚ÄúThis Strain Of The Self‚Äù sounds like the first breakthrough in a long journey ‚Äì it could soundtrack a big budget sci-fi movie where the main character stumbles upon an alien civilization hidden in the forest. Grand scale synths and the presence of Fire-Toolz‚Äôs razored shrieks make the moment even bigger, while each section of the song expresses an emotional wanderlust, a noble desire to explore even ugly territory. It makes sense that this album was an outlet for creator Anders Bach to work through inner turmoil:<br></br>‚ÄúIn the early stages of making the album, I thought I was doing soothing, ambient stuff. But I realized that while keeping myself in a chokehold of comfortable sounds and annoying stereotypical meditation, I had some deeper need to express my emotional state in a more direct way. So I started playing drums on my tracks, I started fiddling with bigger chord-progressions and got back into fusion and prog rock again - something from my childhood I had kept locked away. And everything just started feeling better. I think I subconsciously wanted to convey experiences of death and loss in my immediate family that had happened some years back, and that I had been waiting for a musical way of doing so.‚Äù<br></br><em>I also asked Anders how Fire-Toolz ended up on the album.</em><br></br>‚ÄúThe demo that ended up becoming ‚ÄúThis Strain of the Self (feat. Fire-Toolz)‚Äù had been done for a while, but something was missing. Around that time, I think it was 2019(!), I had been listening to Angel Marcloid‚Äôs Fire-Toolz album <em>Field Whispers (Into The Crystal Palace)</em>, and she became such an inspirational force to me, that I just had to give it a go. I sent her the album and this idea for her contribution as a vocalist and guitarist on ‚ÄúThis Strain‚Äù, and she was onboard instantly. So she plays the guitar parts and sings on that one song and has mastered the full album. Since then we‚Äôve furthered our collaboration, as we‚Äôre both working as sound engineers, so she‚Äôs mastered some albums that I‚Äôve mixed. I think she is one of the most amazing artists on the planet and I‚Äôm proud to consider her a friend.‚Äù<br></br><custom id = "self-vid"></custom><br></br><em>Two trippy music videos accompany <em>Bitumenic</em>, both taking place in strange aquatic environments. Sam Balfus is behind the visuals.</em><br></br>‚ÄúSam did everything, actually, all the art too, apart from two logos that the artist Ida Lissner did. I feel like Sam is a kindred spirit that just suddenly came into my life and changed so many aspects of how I perceive and visualize sound and sonic context. I got in touch with him after I finished mixing the album. I was playing "Dark Souls: Remastered‚Äù and that game was such a wild aesthetic experience for me, so I started digging into its artistic influences and after a deep dive I arrived at the Polish painter Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski. Beksi≈Ñski made these anxiety-inducing sublime paintings that were so sorrowful and beautiful. Sam, whose work I had been loving for years (have you seen his cover for Galen Tipton‚Äôs ‚ÄúFake Meat‚Äù, holy shit), was writing on his Instagram that he was open for commission, so I got a hold of him and showed him this Beksi≈Ñski painting and we immediately hit it off. And a collaboration that for starters was just supposed to be for the album-cover, turned into more art and two huuuuge music videos. We had many talks about the videos, but a liquid environment was a constant that permeated both of them in their beginning stages. Liquid in itself is such a powerful metaphor for me for change in life and death, and Sam took that fascination and brought that - and me - into his beautiful world of creatures, stars and a dark sublimity that for me makes him a modern day Beksi≈Ñski. And since then Sam has been my right hand guy, and we're just getting started. <br></br><custom id = "hel-vid"></custom>`,

Michael: I started playing guitar, my main instrument, probably around seven or eight. And I remember I got an acoustic guitar for my birthday ‚Äì if you watch <em>Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny</em>, there's a guitar that Jack Black has with ‚Äúmonster mash‚Äù written on it. It‚Äôs that guitar, that was the first one I ever got. And I played that for a really long time. I got really lucky and met kids who were really into music. When I was like 10 or 11 I had a next door neighbor who had a band and I was in it. And we even recorded stuff. I have evidence of this ‚Äì I have a CDR of it or something.<br></br><custom id = "jack-pic"></custom><br></br>Q: <em>Why did you decide to release ‚ÄòAll in the Family‚Äô and ‚ÄòLemons and Limes‚Äô at the same time?</em><br></br>I.R. Michael: Back in 2019, I wrote a few tunes with my friend Victor. And I wanted to do this sort of open power trio thing I was really into. At the time I was really into Blake Mills, who has some really great bootleg <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fQ0RubtCyc"><u>videos</u></a> on YouTube of him playing stuff around 2015 in Amsterdam, and he just has this very loose format for all the music. The arrangements are very open, very free. They're kind of like jazz but not really. I wanted to experiment with not really rehearsing a band, but having these tunes. And we did a few shows, and they were really fun and really successful. And I was like, okay, I want to record these. COVID hit, I couldn't record them. So I was holding on to this music for a really long time. Finally, in 2021 I had a friend who was the head engineer of a studio. He had this deal for artists, so I went down to Nashville and recorded with a slightly different group. Victor was still on bass, but we had a percussionist and a drummer. And so we did all this stuff live in the room. And that‚Äôs what became <em>All in the Family</em>.<br></br><custom id = "studio-pic"></custom><br></br>In the meantime, I was recording these freeform, almost experimental pieces at home. It started to feel like those had the same amount of potential as the material I spent a lot of time on in studio, so I started really making a lot of those types of tracks. And that's what became <em>Lemons and Limes</em>. I was finding that when I got tired of working on one project, like recording something for <em>Lemons and Limes</em>, I'd go back to <em>All in the Family</em> and mix stuff and do some overdubs. And when I was tired of doing that, I'd go back to <em>Lemons and Limes</em>. So I started to notice that both these projects were really two sides of the same coin. One of the early ideas I had for the projects was to release it as one whole album. That probably would have been inappropriate.<br></br>Q: <em>Why are the songs on ‚ÄòLemons and Limes‚Äô so short?</em><br></br>I.R. Michael: I was really into this PinkPantheress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLJvWsThYcw"><u>album</u></a> at the time ‚Äì it‚Äôs really concise and &nbsp;every track is just like a minute and 30 seconds long at most. I also really liked <em>The Commercial Album</em> by The Residents. All the songs are a minute long and the whole thesis was all pop songs are basically just one form repeated twice with maybe a bridge in the middle. So if you just have it as one time around on the form, that's a song, and it's over. So yeah, I was just trimming the fat in a way.<br></br><custom id = "residents-pic"><</custom><br></br>Q: <em>‚ÄòLemons and Limes‚Äô has about an equal number of experimental/dissonant and accessible/poppy tracks. They seem to be intentionally spaced throughout the album. How did you handle the tracklisting?</em><br></br>I.R. Michael: The album‚Äôs title is sort of literal for me: half the songs I considered limes, and the half the songs I considered lemons. The lemons were the dissonant ones, like ‚Äúdead rat alert,‚Äù ‚Äúnot sure if you saw that,‚Äù and ‚Äúbad poem.‚Äù The limes were song songs, the more palatable ones. Like ‚Äúautumn in june‚Äù or ‚Äúsound for the summer.‚Äù<br></br>I originally wanted it to be back and forth, lime, lemon, lime, lemon. I knew that I really wanted the lemon ‚Äúnumb at the wall of fear‚Äù to be immediately before ‚Äúsound for the summer,‚Äù the centerpiece of the record. When I went to music school, I had this guitar teacher who was a member of the Lounge Lizards and worked with guys like John Zorn. He thought that audiences really can handle a lot more dissonance and difficult music than I think musicians expect. If you take them on a journey, they're there for it. I've always really stuck by that because I've done shows where I'll play really out there shit and it doesn't seem to faze people. And no one's talking. If you give someone something to latch on to at some point, it will allow for people to be endeared to the music.<br></br><em>Q: I really like the guitar chime in ‚Äúsound for the summer.‚Äù How‚Äôd you come up with that?</em><br></br>I.R. Michael: I had the pedal board plugged into my computer and just cranked the shit out of the distortion. Like most of <em>Lemons and Limes </em>it was made in my room. The riff itself for the song itself, much like a lot of my writing, was conceptualized in my head first. I've noticed that typically I come up with stuff when I'm either walking or doing something active. I wrote the first three songs on <em>All</em> <em>in the Family</em> while I was waiting tables in Nashville. ‚Äúsound for the summer‚Äù was the same thing. I was stocking groceries while I wrote that.<br></br><custom id = "grocery-pic"></custom><br></br>Q: <em>Do you resonate more with ‚ÄòAll in the Family‚Äô or ‚ÄòLemons and Limes?‚Äô Which direction do you want to take in the future?</em><br></br>I.R. Michael: Well, I have about 10 or 11 tunes that I'm working on right now, and I have a working title for the project. The idea is more or less trying to combine them. The palette I liked the most and the things I get most excited by is the <em>Lemons and Limes</em> side. I really like <em>All in the Family</em>, but it‚Äôs old material and I'm not necessarily interested in being that type of songwriter. That's not really how I've been hearing music lately. I really liked the aesthetic I created on <em>Lemons and Limes</em>, but having other people play on it, like <em>All in the Family</em>. So that's definitely the next step.`,

    content: `On an unusually good weather day in February my friend Megan and I met Samara Lubelski in Seward Park. We were interviewing her but as we walked from the park to Henry Street Settlement to East River Park it felt like a friend was showing us around their cool house. Samara grew up in SOHO; NYC has always been her playground. I first met Samara after she played a mesmerizing set on her violin at Montez Radio. <br></br> <custom id = "samara-vid"></custom><br></br><em>When did you first fall in love with music?</em><br></br>One day in elementary school, there was a substitute teacher. And during the lunch hour, he put on The Beatles and started dancing with me and spinning me around. And so I went back home and my mom had a couple of Beatles records. And thus the obsession began.<br></br><em>How did you start playing the violin?</em><br></br>My parents super casually asked me if I'd like to play and, having no idea what I was getting into, I said sure, I'll try this.<br></br><em>How did you put together your first solo violin performance?</em><br></br>I was in Australia doing the tour for <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2839023-Chelsea-Light-Moving"><u>Chelsea Light Moving</u></a> with Thurston Moore, and they needed an opener. So I just did free violin. That wasn't that long ago, maybe 10 years ago. It's been a refinement ever since.<br></br><em>Has it always been the violin for you?</em><br></br>I grew up in lower Manhattan. There was energy everywhere, classical music was not the thing. But I joined my first band as a teenager, and they were like, oh my god, you can play an instrument, and they really encouraged me to develop that. But then over time, of course, I picked up the bass, guitar, vocals, and goofing on every instrument I could kind of get my hands on at one point or another.<br></br><em>So we're at 56 Ludlow Street, can you tell us a little bit about where we are?</em><br></br>This is the former home of Lou Reed, John Cale and Tony Conrad. They lived upstairs. They dressed in all black like rockers, and Cale said that the kids from Seward Park High School down the block would throw rocks at them because they were rockers.<br></br><em>How has the music community changed since you've been in the city?</em><br></br>Everyone was in a band. Rehearsal spaces were super cheap. It's not affordable anymore. It feels like a certain aspect of that vibrancy has dispersed.<br></br><em>What's your favorite show that you've performed?</em><br></br>There's those ones where you think, okay, this is a perfect gig. I've experienced it with Marcia Bassett, and I‚Äôve experienced it with Werner N√∂tzel from <a href="https://metabolismus.bandcamp.com/album/sus"><u>Metabolismus</u></a>. Then there's those really crazy shows ‚Äì I did this weird SXSW thing with Thurston, I think it was the New Wave Bandits, and we were covering The Velvet Underground song ‚ÄúI'm Not a Young Man Anymore.‚Äù There were these waves of love going back and forth between the audience and Thurston. It felt so high energy and then I looked down at my violin and it was unplugged.<br></br><em>Oh no!!</em><br></br>But it was still really great.<br></br><em>What was your time like working at the Rare Book Room as a recording engineer?</em><br></br>Oh, that was amazing. I had just finished tracking my first solo record <em>The Fleeting Skies</em> over at Sumsilobatem, which was the Metabolismus studio in Southern Germany. When I got back to New York, I was really good friends with Nicholas Vernhes, who ran the Rare Book Room. And he was just like, ‚ÄúYou come over here.‚Äù The biggest learning curve, of course, was doing my own sessions there. I did a pretty early one with Matt Valentine for <a href="https://samaralubelski.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-valley"><u><em>In The Valley</em></u></a>.<br></br><em>Do you want to tell us a little bit about where we are and your history with it?</em><br></br>We're at the Henry Street settlement over on Grand Street. I started taking violin lessons here when I was about five. I rode my bike here every Saturday morning for seven, almost eight years.<br></br><custom id = "samara-pic"></custom><br></br><em>Do you have a lot of fond memories here?</em><br></br>I have almost zero fond memories here. My parents were pretty tough with me about practicing, lessons were very old school ‚Äì no fun, no going off the rails and getting creative. It was all about the discipline. It just wasn't my thing.<br></br><em>Have you been back here since as an adult?</em><br></br>Alan Licht did a really great headphones art exhibition up here, so my friend Steve Thorton and I came and did photos here, and we used it on the cover of <a href="https://samaralubelski.bandcamp.com/album/future-slip"><u><em>Future Slip</em></u></a>.<br></br><em>How much of your violin performance is improvised versus planned out?</em><br></br>It's all improvised at this point. I definitely have my particular approach and the sounds I like and my skill set, and then my particular headspace, which I assume is slightly on the darker side.<br></br><em>Your current violin performance is pretty minimal without a lot of effects. But how do you choose the pedals you do use?</em><br></br>I have a weird love affair with the <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MemoryManXO--electro-harmonix-deluxe-memory-man-analog-delay-chorus-vibrato-pedal"><u>Memory Man</u></a>. Doing a lot of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo_(EP)"><u>tremolo</u></a> lately that comes in and out. Even though it looks minimal on the ground, I'm trying to play with the instrument itself as much as possible.<br></br><em>So how intentional are you about planning out what a certain album is going to sound like?</em><br></br>I always have these vague goals, like, this one's going to be harder, or more edgy or more angular. And it almost never happens. Unless like there's some other influence there, like I did a <a href="https://samaralubelski.bandcamp.com/album/joy-rides"><u>cassette</u></a> with Spencer Herbst once and he did all the percussion early on, and he kind of dictated the whole tone. But in terms of writing songs, there's always a pretty consistent approach against my better efforts.<br></br><em>When you're first writing a song. Is it similar to improvising on the stage at all?</em><br></br>Not at all. It‚Äôs very intellectual heavy stuff, very critical. You're still looking for magic. You're looking for this thing that exists outside of yourself and it flows of its own volition. But you have to find it and you have to guide it and hopefully it'll become its own thing. Whereas I feel like with improvising you're already in that headspace allowing for that to happen, or that's the attempt.<br></br><em>Do you want to tell us a little bit about where we are and if you have any connection to the place?</em><br></br>We‚Äôre in East River Park. In this park is the ancient burial ground of the <a href="https://halloffamenyc.bandcamp.com/album/paradise-now"><u>Hall of Fame</u></a> four track where it was laid to rest almost 20 years ago.<br></br><em>Why did you bury the four track?</em><br></br>It was a Tascam cassette four track and it had worked really, really hard. And I thought it deserved a really good resting place. This is one of our favorite places to hang ‚Äì me and the other members of Hall of Fame, Theo Angel and Dan Brown.<br></br><em>Do you have any stories about the bridge itself?</em><br></br>Not on the Williamsburg Bridge, but Tuli Kupferberg from <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/262227-The-Fugs"><u>The Fugs</u></a> jumped off the Manhattan Bridge. And he's the person referred to in <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl"><u>‚ÄúHowl,‚Äù</u></a> &nbsp;Allen Ginsburg's tome. Tuli was the only person who ever survived the jump, he broke his back but survived and went on to have a new family and The Fugs.<br></br><em>Do you still visit Germany often?</em><br></br>Yeah, I haven't been there for about a year, which seems wrong. But almost every solo record I've done minus <a href="https://samaralubelski.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-valley"><u><em>In The Valley</em></u></a> has been partly or wholly recorded or mixed in the Sumsilobatem studio. Hopefully, I'll get to return there sooner rather than later.<br></br><em>How does your process change in a different environment?</em><br></br>Obviously, South Germany is very beautiful, and almost makes one feel &nbsp;innocent, naive to a certain extent. And that definitely seeps into the writing, making it a bit more blissed out with some sort of joy. Whereas living in New York City, it's hard not to be aware of constant change and hustle and intensity. So a lot of the work can be almost reactionary to those influences, which then becomes defensive to some degree, or you can just feel the walls going up.<br></br><em>Do you ever think you'll leave New York?</em><br></br>In a box! I don't know. It's got its grip on me for sure. I grew up here. I've always lived in downtown New York. And I'm in love with its history, I find it kind of mesmerizing. So yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to shake it or not.<br></br><em>Are you currently working on any projects?</em><br></br>Right now the walls are fully up, locked and engaged. I'm working on a song record right now and also working on a violin record. The violin record‚Äôs been recorded with Josh Diamond from <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/252223-Gang-Gang-Dance"><u>Gang Gang Dance</u></a>. And now it's just like editing it and finessing it. The song record has a way more to go. I have some shows coming up with Marcia Bassett and have a bunch of solo shows coming up in New York, of course.`,

Most Arab Strap songs are based on moments of lucidity that unwillingly dawn upon us in the middle of the party, similar to catching one's cocaine-addled reflection in the mirror, and the self-abasement that follows . ‚ÄúI Would Have Liked Me a Lot Last Night‚Äù inverts that dynamic, sympathetically looking at the cascade of emotions we have the next morning.<br></br>"You said we had a good time/I hear I was a right laugh/I really loved you a lot last night/I could've hugged you to death" <br></br>The repetitive and mournful backing track adds weight to what very well could be fleeting moments of kindness, while the narrator betrays a dim awareness as to the cyclical nature of his habits and interpersonal relationships, and how the end of one night is just the start of another (‚ÄúI'm still trying to decide where the weekend ends‚Äù). The song closes with a tongue-in-cheek loop of some anti-drug propaganda, suggesting he's already been too soppy for one day.

    image: SLOWCORE,
    content: `<h2>Abstract</h2>A healthy body of literature has unanimously shown that for a slowcore band to be successful, they must be slow. But just how slow does one need to go, and who is the slowest of them all? These questions have remained unanswered for the thirty-plus years of slowcore‚Äôs existence. In a preliminary attempt to study this topic, we compiled a random sample of five catalog songs from each of the five most successful slowcore bands, and then measured the average BPM of each song list. It was predicted that Codeine or Low would be the slowest slowcore band. Our results indicated that a sample size of five was unsatisfactory for determining the overall slowness of each band. We then took the average BPM of each band‚Äôs entire discography ‚Äì this was found to be a much more accurate indicator of a band‚Äôs overall slowness. Based on our results, Codeine is the slowest slowcore band of all time. The results were satisfactory to the researchers, especially to Parker, whose favorite slowcore band is Codeine. There is implication for future research on the relative slowness of slowcore compared to the slowness of other slow music.<br></br><h2>1. Introduction</h2>Slowcore is a genre that emerged in the 90‚Äôs, during a time when the rock mainstream was increasingly favoring heavier, more punk-like styles such as grunge. True to the name, the sound of slowcore is slow, guitar heavy rock, with a tendency towards somber melodies and melancholic lyrics. Early slowcore bands that set a blueprint for the genre include Low, Codeine, Seam, and Bedhead. Initial reaction to the genre was mixed ‚Äì some fell head over heels for slowcore, while others didn‚Äôt get the appeal and were confounded by the style. While remaining influential for many rock acts, the number of pure slowcore bands dwindled significantly as the new millennium began.<br></br>Slowcore has seen a renaissance in recent years. The audience for original 90‚Äôs slowcore has grown drastically, while modern indie bands have increasingly drawn upon the sound of slowcore. New bands whose primary style is slowcore are emerging at a faster rate than they have in decades. With the saliency of slowcore at such a high level, it seemed an appropriate time as ever to delve into the question: what makes a slowcore band truly <em>slow</em>?<br></br><h2>2. Methods</h2>As the supreme surveyors of slowcore, we were qualified to select the five most successful slowcore bands based on pure intuition. The bands we selected included Codeine, Low, Acetone, Seam, and Bedhead (One may wonder why Duster was not included, but they're obviously drugged out spacey post-rock, and NOT slowcore). Every song within each band‚Äôs discography was assigned a number, with 1 being the first song the band released and continuing onward in chronological order. We used a random number generator with bounds set by the numerical range of each band‚Äôs released songs from 1990 to 2001 in order to get a random sample of five songs from each selected band. BPM was selected as the best indicator of a given song‚Äôs slowness. We used an online tool to find the average BPM for each five song sample. The API used by the tool required use of Spotify, which unfortunately restricted song selection to those available on Spotify. After determining the results of this preliminary study to be unsatisfactory, we took the average BPM of the entire discography for each band between 1990-2001 (every song that was available on Spotify).<br></br><h2>3. Results</h2>According to the results of our initial study that used a sample of five random songs for each artist (see Table 2), Codeine is the slowest slowcore band with an average of 101 BPM. Acetone, Seam, and Low had very similar averages, with 112 BPM, 114 BPM, and 116 BPM, respectively (see Table 1). Bedhead was an outlier with an average of 140 BPM (see chart 1).<br></br>For study 2 we averaged each band‚Äôs entire discography (that was available on Spotify), resulting in data that was less spread out (see chart 2) ‚Äì Codeine had the lowest average: 102 BPM (an increase of one measure of BPM from study 1), while Bedhead had the highest: 124 BPM (a decrease of 16 measures of BPM from study 1). Low experienced the greatest change in average BPM from study 1 to study 2, decreasing from 116 BPM in study 1 to 103 BPM in study 2. Acetone and Seam experienced slight increases in BPM ‚Äì Acetone increased from 112 BPM to 117 BPM, while Seam increased from 114 BPM to 116 BPM (see table 1).<br></br><h3>Table 1: Average BPM of Study 1 and 2</h3><custom id="table-one"></custom><h3>Table 2: BPM of Selected Codeine Songs</h3><custom id="table-two"></custom><h3>Chart 1: Average BPM of Study 2</h3><custom id="chart-one"></custom><h3>Chart 2: Average BPM of Study 2</h3><custom id="chart-two"></custom><h2>4.Conclusion</h2>The results of study 1 and 2 confirmed Parker‚Äôs hypothesis that Codeine is the best slowcore band. Although this made Parker very happy, it should be noted that there are several limitations to this study. Perhaps the biggest limitation is the use of BPM as the sole measure of a song‚Äôs slowness. Our study did not take into consideration the more subjective measure of how slow a song actually <em>feels</em>. For example, most Bedhead songs <em>feel </em>much slower than most Seam songs, but Seam had a much lower average BPM than Bedhead. This could be due to the possibility of a song being played in half time ‚Äì which means that a song <em>feels </em>twice as slow as the song‚Äôs actual BPM. However, this would be a difficult quality to measure on a large scale as we did not have access to a tool that could identify when a song is played in half time. The tool we used was another limitation of our study, as it restricted us to only including songs that were available on Spotify. This was mostly an issue with Acetone‚Äôs catalog, who only have one album available on Spotify along with their later compilation. We also missed a single EP from Low in our data set.<br></br>One interesting feature of the online tool we used to measure BPM was that it would ‚Äúrate‚Äù our playlists with a 5 star scale. It hated all of them for being too obscure and only filled with one artist, but it especially hated Low. The website gave them an average .3 stars less than the other bands with both the five song playlist and the full discography playlist. Naturally one is left to ask, ‚ÄúHey what‚Äôs up with that?‚Äù We felt the same way, and thus recommend finding a less aggro BPM tool if one wishes to replicate our study.<br></br>So how does slowcore stack up against other music? We compared their BPM with the first slow album that popped into our heads, Scott Walker and Sun 0))‚Äôs collaboration <em>Soused. Soused </em>ended up clocking at 84, a full 18 less beats per minute than Codeine. Do better, slowcore.<br></br>What bands did we miss? What would be a better measure of ‚Äúslowness?‚Äù What‚Äôs the slowest album you can think of?

    content: `What better way to celebrate Slowcore Week than with a forgotten country B-side from Mark Eitzel and Co.? ‚ÄúThe Right Thing‚Äù was released on the back of the <em>Rise </em>EP, when the band was on the precipice of a radio friendly pivot ushered by some newfound success in the UK. While the resulting album <em>Everclear </em>might contain some of their most popular work, I cannot say it is my personal favorite. While revisiting the era I was ambivalent to some of the over-the-top production style and weakness in concept, but Eitzel does his best with the sort of larger than life emotion found in the language of the country standard, bringing a sharp wit and a turn of phrase that would make a young Jeff Tweedy blush. The track has a glibness to its delivery that borders on parody, but manages to stay earnest with some convincing performances all around. Reassuring the down-and-out is one of Americana's favorite preoccupations, and this song is a shining example.`,

    content: `Chris Brokaw is cold. So are the other 20 odd people gathered in <a href="https://www.propertyistheft.org/"><u>Property Is Theft</u></a> for one of the coldest sets Brooklyn‚Äôs seen this year. At the mic, he recalls a similarly frigid show he played with <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/89573-Come-2"><u>Come</u></a> once. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm colder now than I was then‚Äù he says.<br></br><br></br>One freezing show was all it took to sell me on the solo work of Chris Brokaw. I attended because Chris drummed for my favorite slowcore band, Codeine. But his many solo projects proved to be a treasure trove of solid rock songs and post-rock experiments, and I wanted to know more.<br></br><br></br><em>What was your first musical creation?</em><br></br><br></br>I remember writing little songs in my head when I was a kid. Just little bits. I never shared them with anyone (don't ask, they weren't particularly good). When I was 12 or 13 my friends and I would mess around with cassettes, kind of remixing songs we hated (The Eagles, etc). Again, nothing particularly brilliant. When I was 13 I started playing in a band with another guitarist and drummer and we wrote instrumental rock music.<br></br><br></br><em>If you had to pick, guitar or drums?</em><br></br><br></br>Guitar. I'm saying this in the desert island sense, like, at least I could play songs alone with guitar. I feel like I'm better at guitar than drums, though I think my drumming is improving.<br></br><br></br><em>With Numero‚Äôs </em><a href="https://numerogroup.com/blogs/stories/numero-twenty"><u><em>anniversary show</em></u></a><em> in LA and </em><a href="https://codeineband.bandcamp.com/album/dessau"><u><em>‚ÄòDessau‚Äô</em></u></a><em> being given an official release, how does it feel to be reunited with Codeine for the second time?</em><br></br><br></br>It feels more relaxed and more natural than the reunion in 2012. Back then it felt more like I was in a time warp; now, Codeine music feels more eternal, like it's part of my life forever, not simply something from the past that I'm revisiting. I'm also really glad for the opportunity to spend more time with John and Steve.<br></br><br></br><em>Many Codeine fans, myself included, were not around for the band‚Äôs original incarnation. What did we miss out on?</em><br></br><br></br>We played shorter sets and we tried to be really loud. In some ways it was a bit more confrontational. I think the whole thing we were doing was more surprising then, somehow. Many people thought we were freaks and it could be a bit polarizing, though then as now the people who got it really got it.<br></br><br></br><em>Your show with Codeine at Union Pool was incredible, I couldn‚Äôt stop headbanging. How was it for you?</em><br></br><br></br>Both shows were exciting. I feel very comfortable in that music. It requires a lot of concentration. I enjoy the odd places it takes me physically.<br></br><br></br><em>One of my favorite parts of Codeine‚Äôs ‚ÄòFrigid Stars‚Äô is your glacial approach to drumming. How‚Äôd you develop that style?</em><br></br><br></br>I developed that style for Codeine. Really, I developed it with John and Steve. I think we all adapted our playing for the purpose of playing Codeine music. It wasn't easy but once I got it together I think it changed me.<br></br><br></br><em>Any influences?</em><br></br><br></br>I could tell you some of my favorite drummers, though I'm not sure it would necessarily illuminate things?... Mitch Mitchell (Jimi Hendrix Experience), John Bonham (Led Zeppelin), Paul Cook (Sex Pistols), John Maher (Buzzcocks), Ben Koller (Converge), Britt Walford (Slint), John Herndon (Tortoise), Danny Richmond (Charles Mingus).<br></br><br></br><em>Aside from playing in Come, Codeine, The New Year, and The Lemonheads (just to name a few), you‚Äôve released some great albums under your own name. When did you first start recording solo material?</em><br></br><br></br>I started writing a bunch of music around 1999/2000. I was still in Come and at that point anything I would have written would have been for Come, but I knew I didn't want this to be a Come record. I couldn't really put a name to it, but eventually concluded that it was going to be a solo album and I'd play everything. It was very unnerving but I spent about a year writing and recording demos for an album I eventually recorded called <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/2371450-Chris-Brokaw-Red-Cities"><u><em>Red Cities</em></u></a><em>.</em> I was obsessed, I couldn't really think about anything else for a year or so. It just kind of overtook me.<br></br><br></br><em>Your solo work has a wide range of sound and style, from droney guitar noise to cinematic post-rock to quieter, jazzier affairs. Does any particular style feel most ‚Äúat home‚Äù to you?</em><br></br><br></br>That's a good question. Last night I was giving a guitar lesson and I taught this girl how to play "Ever Fallen In Love" by the Buzzcocks, and I felt like that style of music is the most natural thing in the world, or at least maybe the most natural thing to me.<br></br><br></br><em>Your most recent album ‚ÄòPuritan‚Äô is a fantastic rock album replete with lyrics. Given that many of your releases are instrumental, is it an extra challenge to write lyrics?</em><br></br><br></br>Yes, it's a challenge, but when I get it right it's satisfying. I've become more exacting and critical about lyrics, but at the same time I also feel like songs take a life of their own and do what they will, and I try to allow that. They do things I don't necessarily want them to do but for me that's become a weirdly welcome, or inevitable, part of the process.<br></br><br></br><em>The lyrics of the </em><a href="https://chrisbrokaw12xu.bandcamp.com/album/puritan"><u><em>‚ÄòPuritan‚Äô</em></u></a><em> track ‚ÄúThe Periscope Kids‚Äù include all the track titles of your 2015 album </em><a href="https://chrisbrokaw12xu.bandcamp.com/album/the-periscope-twins"><u><em>‚ÄòThe Periscope Twins.‚Äô</em></u></a><em> I thought that was an interesting bit of worldbuilding, how did you build up to that?</em><br></br><br></br>I had the vocal song written but I wasn't ready to record it. But I referenced it on the instrumental album. Those lyrics were a bit of a veiled cry for help at a troubled period of my life and I guess I had to do it twice/incrementally.<br></br><br></br><em>The 2018 album (</em><a href="https://charnelground12xu.bandcamp.com/album/charnel-ground"><u><em>Charnel Ground</em></u></a><em>) you made with Kid Millions and James McNew is one of my favorite collaborations you‚Äôve done. How did that project come about?</em><br></br><br></br>I'd met John (Kid Millions) through the music scene and we played a show in Brooklyn as a duo, kind of half songs and half jams. He suggested we record and about a week before the session he suggested inviting James. I thought it was a great idea. I love what we all did together! I'm very proud of that record. I brought in a couple of those pieces and the rest we made up in the studio. James only did the recording, and was replaced by Doug McCombs. We did a couple of small tours and some recordings (quite a while ago, I think in 2018??) and I hope we'll resume. Pandemic was not good for Charnel Ground.<br></br><br></br><em>You‚Äôre quite prolific, seems like every other week you release a new project or form a new band. What keeps you coming back for more?</em><br></br><br></br>Just being excited about music. And continuing to meet people and wanting to collaborate with them.<br></br><br></br><em>Are you working on any upcoming projects?</em><br></br><br></br>I'm in a new band here in Boston called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lupocittaband/?ref=py_c&amp;paipv=0&amp;eav=Afa2g6eXpIB4h0q43mJ3iw15H-5rzTt1KaHryA1JnooX-6HvZdWSyFFR4h1hjYUg990&amp;_rdr"><u>Lupo Citta</u></a>. Kind of garagey, and I'm mostly playing rhythm guitar, I definitely play in a different way than usual. I have a couple of other things I'm hoping will happen but they involve people in other states and I feel like that process may be harder now than it was for a while, partly due to the pandemic and what it did to me, which is that I want to be home more. I used to travel constantly and I no longer want to do that. I like being at home.`,

It works within the bounds of Ilian Tape‚Äôs sound, but paradoxically expands its limits with Marco‚Äôs fine-tuned structure tinkering. ‚ÄúWave Mode‚Äù sounds a bit like a rocking boat‚Äìsynths spray into the beat like water on the bow ‚Äì but Marco still manages to run a tight ship.<br></br><custom id="marco-vid"></custom>`,

The track has a stutter-stop rambunctiousness, but behind the scenes I think it‚Äôs a little more thought out than chaotic middle school me. The shouted, nearly indecipherable vocals remind me of <a href="https://prrfectpussy.bandcamp.com/album/say-yes-to-love"><u>Perfect Pussy</u></a>, but the squeals and grunts of a synth and the clutter of cowbell-saturated drums make ‚ÄúCandy Crush‚Äù a lot more playful.

There are hints of everything from Slint, to Godspeed You Black Emperor, to The Microphones buried in this unwieldy and hard to categorize album.

    content: `<em>You can find the audio version of this interview <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/plasticstyledotnet/an-interview-with-shots/"><u>here.</u></a></em><br></br>Recently I got the chance to talk with Shots, a three member group composed of twins Matt and John Friberg along with Daniel DiMaggio. Their music can best be described as a collection of quiet sounds created with a wide range of instruments, tools and toys. Their latest record is 2019‚Äôs <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/13878250-Shots-Private-Hate"><u><em>Private Hate</em></u></a>.<br></br><custom id="shots-pic"></custom><em>Q: How did Shots form?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>Daniel used to work at The Princeton Record Exchange, and Matt and I were in high school and used to go in there after class. And so we eventually realized that we like the same kind of music because Daniel was working at the register and we would be like, ‚ÄúHave you heard this?‚Äù Then Daniel would be like, ‚ÄúYeah, it's sick‚Äù or something. That happened like 20 times and we just became friends from there. And then we started playing music together a little bit.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, we played together in 2007 a couple of times.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>Did we record any of that?<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I have a four track tape of it. John's like told me to listen to it so many times. I should listen to it.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>John and I played a one off show with our friend Dave like ten years ago, it sounded similar to Shots. It was really quiet. We played outside.<br></br><em><b>Q:</b></em><b> </b><em>Did Shots start out with a similar sound to how it is now, or did that take a while to develop?</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>Similar in the sense that a lot of the equipment we used was the same. But maybe it evolved a little bit and changed. I feel like it was more frenetic before, but it could be that again.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I think I use more toys and stuff now.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>Same.<br></br><b>John: </b>For me it was acoustic for all the early stuff. I‚Äôd play guitar.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Remember the first time you played bass?<br></br><b>John: </b>Oh, yeah.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>That was like the first time I feel like we played.<br></br><b>John: </b>Yeah, that was crazy. I wonder how that would sound now, too.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>What happened the first time you played bass?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>I think it was, like, melodic, right?<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, it was more normal. And I was playing the piano. This was not that long ago. I would consider it the first Shots thing. So we‚Äôve played continuously since then. It was definitely pretty different, but I don't really remember what it sounded like.<br></br><b>John: </b>I think we played in Daniel‚Äôs practice space and it got messed up or something.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I was doing something really wrong, it sounded like it was panned so that both channels were really quiet. I don't know what it could have been at this point.<br></br><b>John: </b>And we also ended up sort of trashing the practice space.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>We kept on fucking up the recording and it ended up being like 6 a.m. before we were done. We were too tired to clean up so we planned to come back the next day. Then I guess another band was using the practice space and got really mad. They thought we just made a mess on purpose. They didn't know it was our gear, I guess.<br></br><b>John: </b>They took pictures of the practice space and sent it around on an email thread for everybody that used the practice space.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>So the first public representation of Shots was a messy practice room.</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>Yeah.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>In terms of the actual sound of Shots, the term ‚Äúnon-music‚Äù has been thrown around some. Do you guys find that to be a helpful term, or would you push against that?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>I guess the term can be useful in a sense, as far as a way to describe the sound. When that term started being used, there was us and a few other bands that were included under that umbrella.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>It's not a very accurate term, but it was used at a specific time and described other stuff, all of which sounds like us. So it was useful to describe that. I don‚Äôt dislike it.<br></br><b>John: </b>I think there are some shared sensibilities between the people that seem to be included in that. So that's fine too. But it‚Äôs obviously just a <a href="https://www.discogs.com/genre/non-music"><u>discogs</u></a> thing.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Oh yeah, it‚Äôs used to describe spoken word records and stuff.<br></br><b>John: </b>Yeah. And field recordings and all kinds of stuff. But it's definitely not like the same kind of non-music.<br></br><b>John: </b>I don't know if people still use it.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I haven't really heard it used as much, but maybe I'm out of the loop.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Why the name Shots?</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>I think it was the name of a <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/891935-Steve-Lacy-Shots"><u>Steve Lacy</u></a> record, right?<br></br><b>John: </b>I think that was actually a coincidence.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>Some of the stuff is named after hardcore songs.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah most of the other stuff is.<br></br><b>John: </b>For me ‚ÄúShots‚Äù can be confusing out of context as a single word. And so I just like that effect.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Are there consistent roles for each person? Or does it depend on the track?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I feel like now at least we all have our individual setups. And it sort of changes, but it's not like we have to switch or do anything different. John has been working on his set up consistently and refining it. I maybe do that less.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I've been trying to get rid of stuff and use my own body as much as possible.<br></br><b>John:</b> Matt contributes psychically in ways that aren't necessarily sound based. Matt's role has evolved from sparse, like percussion or the small toys or whatever into things outside of sound entirely ‚Äì a lot of movement.<br></br><b>Matt:</b> That's an interesting way to put it, because I was trying to think about what‚Äôs influencing me recently. I saw this video by Peter Van Riper called ‚ÄúWalking Dance‚Äù and it was just kind of like slow walking meditation, but I feel like there's an energetic difference when it's done in a certain way. And maybe that's what I'm like thinking about when contributing to Shots, just cultivating a certain energy.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>When I listen to Shots, the energy that comes across is very quiet. It makes me focus in and try to listen. When people listen to Shots should it be more attentive listening or could it be used as background music?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>For me it could be either.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I think about a certain kind of paying attention to something that isn't, like, strenuous or hyper-focused, but concentrating in a way that's more relaxed. And that I'm not saying that's how people should listen to the music or anything, but‚Äì<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I guess that's what I‚Äôm doing when I listen to this kind of music and enjoy it.<br></br><b>John: </b>I don't think we're making stuff to become part of the environment that it's being played in. If you wanted to listen with headphones and that's all you're doing, everything is in the recording so you can do that and it would be appropriate. It's all there on the recording.<br></br><b>Matt:</b> Related to this, a cool part of our shows is when we start and people don't know we started because of what we sound like. So there's a space in between us playing and people not paying attention, and then they notice.<br></br><b>John: </b>That‚Äôs one of my favorite parts too.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Do y‚Äôall have any specific places in mind when putting tracks together?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I just literally think of the places where they're recorded. On <em>Private Hate</em>, most of the tracks are recorded in different places, some of which are actual field recordings.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>At one point, Daniel, you're literally outside in your car and we're in the apartment.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, my old apartment. And I was playing stuff from my car. It was all audible through the window.<br></br><b>John: </b>I also think about the place where it was recorded. Obviously you're recording one place and listening somewhere else. I'm also aware of actual space, like the space between me and the wall or something. I‚Äôm into thinking about the space that exists between me and something else. That could be placement of speakers in different parts of the room, or it can be movement from one place to another, having the mics set up and walking around them.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>For me personally, it's just my basic perception. I just want it to sound like how you experience sound in a room or a building or something. I never play through a PA or anything just to have things in specific locations.<br></br><b>John: </b>I feel like when we play shows we usually don't use the PA.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>John and Daniel are both masters at field recording. Really good at it but they use it in humble ways. So it's not this big grand statement or something when using these recordings, but a lot of that gets incorporated into like live sets and stuff. So spatially, I mean, there's all kinds of different spaces going on at once, you know?<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Are the field recordings planned out in terms of place and time, or are they more spontaneous than that?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>They're usually pretty thought through. I know that I'm going to bring my gear because I want to record something, and usually I have an idea of what it is if I'm going to somebody's house and it's like really deep in the woods or something. Although now that I'm working from home, I'll hear shit outside and I can easily just run out and do it. So that's sort of spontaneous.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I guess any time 
    I'm recording, it's because I'm somewhere where I'm intending to do it. Even though sometimes I'll just have a handheld zoom recorder.<br></br><b>John:</b> I feel like you do more of that.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>But it's not like I carry it around anyway. And I could record stuff on my phone, but I just don't. I try to only do it when I‚Äôm intending to.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Do field recordings make you listen to sounds differently or pick up on these weird sounds that are in the background that you wouldn't have otherwise?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, I feel like I just do that as a result of listening to this kind of music for so long. For entertainment even. I think it gives me ideas of what to do personally in Shots.<br></br><b>John: </b>Sometimes I hear a situation happening and try to recreate it. It's like Foley recording. Like yogurt and putting, like, this thing in it to make it sound weird.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Let's talk about the live performances and how those are approached and the differences between that and the recordings.</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>For me I think it used to be more improvisation based. But recently I've been mapping out what to do when we perform down to every single little movement and sound.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I do the same stuff that I would do live, but you can't really hear a lot of it on the recording. I think for some of <em>Private Hate</em> I just went to Daniel's apartment and figured out what I was going to use when I got there. Recently when we prepare for shows, I've been making videos and sending them to John and Daniel and I like those on their own.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah, those are sick.<br></br><b>John</b>: I like how we've done shows in different combinations. Daniel and I have played a couple of shows together without Matt. Matt has played at least one show where it's just him as Shots. I played a show recently that was just me as Shots.<br></br><b>John: </b>It makes it more sustainable and flexible.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I kind of don't like this aspect, but for the live shows I have to amplify what I'm doing as compared to the recording. But I try to minimize the degree to which I change stuff from recording versus live.<br></br><b>John: </b>Yeah. But I guess when we're live, what's the point if people can't even hear it? Like, what's the point of being there? But there was one time where we didn't really have to worry about that because I dropped an entire table worth of gear. Yeah. That was loud.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>What thought was put into the tracklisting and the journey that Private Hate takes you through?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>It was painstaking putting that album together. Editing gets really intense and lots of time is spent on listening really intently. The order of things on that album was definitely calculated.<br></br><custom id="shots-vid"></custom><br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>I did notice that pretty much all of the tracks, there's some kind of persistent background noise. Are those natural background noises of whatever room or area you were in, or were those added in afterwards to give it a certain atmosphere?</em><br></br><b>Daniel: </b>It's different from track to track. I do know that sometimes I would use a mixer and just turn the mixer up really loud so it makes a hiss. But I think that's only on some things.<br></br><b>John:</b> Well, there's one track that‚Äôs a recording of a room, and a preamp is running out of batteries. So the recording flickers and then goes into this weird bad battery sound.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>That's on the last track.<br></br><b>Matt:</b> I feel like there were so many conversations about unintentional background noise on tracks.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>We once recorded so quietly that there was a grounding hum. It was horrible. I remember we tried to salvage it for like the next 24 hours. We didn't go to sleep, just obsessively listening to it, trying to say that a certain part was ok. But it all just sounded terrible.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>It's funny that you pick up on the sound because then it's vindicating. Especially John and Daniel are listening to these things and identifying these hisses or whatever that aren't supposed to be there. I guess it is worth doing that.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I don't think there is ever a case where it's added after the fact.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Which is better, static or silence?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>I would pick static.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I would probably pick silence because I have a ten month old baby and I don't get much.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I guess I pick silence, but static to me has the connotation of radio static, which I don't like.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>I think they both suck.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>But then silence is not actually possible.<br></br><b>Matt: </b>There's people that go into rooms where the sound is sucked out of them.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>I'm very curious as to what's next for Shots. And then also if there's any individual projects anyone's working on, they want to talk about, feel free to do that as well.</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>This interview actually comes at an interesting time because I feel like we're potentially going to play some shows coming up. We're kind of getting back into the groove. We're working on booking a few shows.<br></br><b>John:</b> We're going to try to do a couple rounds of maybe two shows at a time in close proximity to each other. I live in Providence now and Matt lives in upstate New York. Daniel is in NYC, so I'd probably try to book a couple of shows around Providence and then maybe a couple of shows in NYC and then maybe somewhere in-between. But we just started trying to figure that out. So hopefully in the next few months we'll play some shows. And then there's like tons of stuff that we have recorded.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>We definitely could put out multiple releases, but we think we all would just want to do new recording stuff before.<br></br><b>John: </b>I feel like now we approach recording a little bit differently. There's hours of us playing together. So it would be cool to put out the old stuff, like a short seven inch. There were talks about that a long time ago and the person who was gonna do it might still want to do it. So I just like the idea of it being a possibility.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>As of two weeks ago, he said he still wanted to do it.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>So is this a unique scenario where you have a huge backlog of recorded stuff, or do you start off each new album with newly recorded stuff?</em><br></br><b>Matt: </b>I think we've just recorded a few times and we didn't release anything in that time. But if we release something again soon, we‚Äôll probably just record something new.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Are there any individual projects anyone wants to talk about?</em><br></br><b>John: </b>I just finished something for our friend Ben, who‚Äôs starting a label. He does a newsletter, but also a podcast called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/anomiaprod/apod0004-ben-kudler-computer-music-for-dorks-episode-one"><u>Computer Music for Dorks</u></a>. It goes into the history of electronic and computer music and stuff. I think he's going to put out something solo of mine on his new label. I have these sculptures that I want to make, the audio portion of it will be released as just that. But it ties back to the sculpture which is like the main thing. So the release will be one of those.<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>I have a rock band and I'm playing some shows, but I don't have any releases coming up specifically.<br></br><b>Q: </b>Are you referring to <a href="https://homeblitz.bandcamp.com/"><u>Home Blitz</u></a>?<br></br><b>Daniel: </b>Yeah.`,

    image: FAUST_THUMBNAIL,
    content: `Something I find compelling about Faust is the flippancy with which they handle their lengthier compositions. A ten minute experimentation like ‚ÄúNo Harm‚Äù would be the album centerpiece for a more self-serious group, but Faust defang the concept and deliver another practical joke in the long string of pastiches that comprise their first masterpiece, ‚ÄúSo Far.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Harm‚Äù has a simple enough structure, beginning with a slow orchestral crescendo paired with some modest guitar picking that eventually descends into a 7 minute jam. The nonsensical lyrics ‚ÄúDaddy take the banana/ Tomorrow is Sunday'' are repeated endlessly, delivered with such spite and intensity it almost feels like the group have a bone to pick. Here Faust are at their closest to hard rocking contemporaries Can and Amon D√º√ºl II, and the track does feel like a jab at the very concept of this style of progressive rock. Creating their first commercial sounding album after the modest returns from their debut must have come with some baggage, but this frustration is balanced by the fact that Faust are having a damn fun time making it. These two competing impulses - playing with your food and eating it - keep the track feeling alive some 50 years later. Regardless of how Faust felt about the tracks content, they must have known they had struck gold in its execution ‚Äì the dissonant opening of ‚ÄúNo Harm‚Äù would be the blueprint for the patchwork style of their next ‚Äúalbum‚Äù <em>The Faust Tapes.</em>`,

    content: `Crying Kitten‚Äôs <em>LOST IDENTITY 3 </em>is a forest of ambient noise, with ‚ÄúAll the Formal Ways of Sound Torture‚Äù residing smack in the middle of the overgrowth. It's the loudest song on the album and one of the few to feature any percussion whatsoever, but it feels less like a climax and more like a long fall. One step into this track and the earth gives way, into cavernous vocals and crunching drums that spell doom. Feels like slow motion falling in a dark cave. A wormlike bass wriggles deep below, eventually sucking up all the sonics until the forest is quiet once again.`,

    content: `‚ÄúBurnin‚Äô For You‚Äù is one of those songs I listen to because the best part takes a healthy scoop out of my noggin‚Äôs dopamine pool and hands it to me with a smile (in a sugar cone). It‚Äôs really a two-scoop kinda deal - you have that rollicking riff that opens the song, bold as spicy chocolate or something, immediately followed by clear blue harmonies that are giving mint chocolate chip. It‚Äôs an odd pairing, the vocals sound ambient and placid, out of place in a lusty rock song. But just like my favorite The Cars song (‚ÄúMagic‚Äù), there‚Äôs something spellbinding about the combination. The part only happens twice the whole song, at the very beginning and after the first chorus. At four minutes and thirty seconds long, they could have easily fit it in again but don‚Äôt, to my simultaneous chagrin and pleasure. I want to hear the part more but such a popular song could get old quickly; BOC were smart to take the good taste route. The end of the song delivers one final hit with the minty harmonies on the last note, leaving me burnin‚Äô for the track evermore.`,

    content: `I was a first week freshman at UCLA, a willing sheep to any social event with the opportunity to meet fellow strangers in need of life. Our dorm floor had free tickets to a jazz festival so we were herded into a bus that took us downtown to a venue so modest I can‚Äôt remember its name but you could see the Hollywood sign from your seat. There were a handful of acts including an experimental orchestra which was pretty cool. But the last act was different. It lifted me out of a jazz-induced sleepy haze and muttered small talk with new friends into a New World, a World where jazz is <em>jazz</em>.<br></br>An old man wearing colorful robes had shuffled on stage. He was dragging a heavy chain and gently shook it as he walked; strapped to his neck was a tenor saxophone. I didn‚Äôt know who he was but he carried a Presence that made me sit up straight and lean in ‚Äì here was a master. Masters have no need for pretense, he made that clear with how he crouched into his horn to emit ragged breaths of beauty that sometimes swelled into screams, sometimes laying his sax to rest to give into the joy of music with that old man, unbridled happiness type of dancing. The biggest surprise came when he traded sax for throat. His warble drifted through the crowd like a warm wave and suddenly I felt more spiritually mature than I had 5 minutes before.<br></br>When he was through I was astonished and had to know his name. He was Pharoah Sanders, of course, a stalwart of spiritual jazz who had for more than 5 decades shaped towers of introspection and universal love with his golden horn. Me, I had been alive for less than half his career so I had to start with the big one, 1969‚Äôs <em>Karma</em>.<br></br><em>Karma </em>consists of two songs; the first is Pharoah‚Äôs greatest epic, titled after a promise: ‚ÄúThe Creator Has A Master Plan.‚Äù It‚Äôs so celestial and grand-scope, that each section of the song ‚Äì from the untroubled yodel of Leon Thomas to the rapturous tears of Pharoah‚Äôs sax ‚Äì feels like stages of a life that reached <a href="https://livingalifeofmeaning.com/where-are-you-on-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs"><u>transcendence</u></a>. Back on Earth though my dormmates weren‚Äôt too thrilled by the knottier sections of the 30 minute opus so I decided to show them the second song instead, the more mellow ‚ÄúColors.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rollicking ocean or a windy forest depending on if you listen to the constant sparkle of the piano or the rustling percussion. A few spins of <em>Karma </em>and my brainfolds were permanently tie-dyed by Pharoah‚Äôs otherworldly approach to jazz, and he soon became one of my all-time favorite artists.<br></br>Fast forward five years and I‚Äôm sitting by a small creek in a Texas park: Ben and I are waiting for a car problem to be fixed during our road trip from Tennessee to California. I‚Äôm listening to Pharoah Sanders‚Äô brand new record with Floating Points and London Philharmonic Orchestra called <em>Promises</em>. I‚Äôm crying a bit. It‚Äôs a soft affair ‚Äì the synth‚Äôs earnest lilt evokes that same inquisitive feeling as looking up at the stars, Pharoah‚Äôs sax is a soft caress delivered with the wisdom of an old man who‚Äôs been out to sea more than he can count, and the strings add a tearful touch, light but carrying the world's weight. The whole album flows just like that little stream I was watching, like a delicate microcosm. It feels like a solemn reflection, an apt last album for the Master.<br></br>Pharoah Sanders has left this Earth but he was never fully on it; the spirit that flowed through his lips and into his horn taught me how to float too.`,

    content: `<a href="https://joyer.bandcamp.com/"><u>Joyer</u></a> is a band of two brothers from New Jersey. They‚Äôve been labeled as slowcore but don‚Äôt like to be boxed in. I talked to them at Marsha P. Johnson Park right before a storm rolled in.<br></br><br></br><custom id="joyer-vid"></custom><br></br><br></br><em>Q: How did y‚Äôall start playing music together?</em><br></br><b>Shane:</b> We both started playing music at a pretty young age. Our parents were always into listening to music, and our dad played a little bit of guitar, and then we both took music lessons growing up and always wanted to be in bands. Nick was in a couple of other bands, and then we realized that we work really well together and have really similar taste in music, so it made sense starting to play together.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>We both were in band in elementary school, but it took a while for music to take for us. We always liked it, but we both quit a bunch of instruments before we got going.<br></br><em>Q: What‚Äôs it like being brothers in a band?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>Being brothers in a band together, It's a lot easier than I think people assume because we get along really well, as opposed to other brothers. I guess people like to point out brother bands that don't work out, but we're very similar so it's not really a problem right now at least.<br></br><b>Shane: </b>It's always nice just having someone else who gets what you're trying to do. So if either of us get stuck in terms of writing stuff like the other one could step in and help. It used to be way easier because we used to always live together. So we could just like always be working on stuff and be able to really dive into any ideas that we get right as we get them. But it's still been working out really well.<br></br><em>Q: Is Joyer a slowcore band?</em> <br></br><b>Shane: </b>So I guess we didn't really start the band with intentions to make slowcore music. But a lot of people when they first started listening to us would compare us to different slowcore bands. I feel like that's kind of how that label started, but I don't know, it's really hard for me to describe the music or put it under a specific genre. But maybe I'm just really bad at that personally.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>It kind of just matches our personality. We're kind of lowkey anyways when we first started recording we couldn't get any dynamics out of our music at all. So I think it came from that because we had like a single USB mic and it just kind of sounded terrible, so you couldn't really tell what was going on. I think that added to our sound.<br></br><em>Q: Any slowcore bands y‚Äôall are particularly fond of?</em><br></br><b>Shane: </b>I really like the band Acetone a lot, and I'm pretty inspired by them. I like how mellow and quiet they kind of are throughout all of their songs. But then they weave in these really nice melodic vocal parts. I feel like it's a nice contrast to like the laid back and stripped down instrumentals. That's something I try to do.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>We're pretty inspired by codeine too. I like how they have all these dynamics that I've been trying to put into our music more recently. I think we've been getting slowly heavier and heavier, and that's definitely a big codeine influence because they can get really loud but also get really quiet.<br></br><em>Q: What‚Äôs the process like for writing lyrics?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>I think for a lot of our lyrics we try to paint visual images maybe because we always write the instrumentals first. What we're picturing when we're listening to the instrumentals helps us inform our lyrics a bit.<br></br><em>Q: Is there an ideal audience for playing live?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>I'm just happy if people show up and seem to be enjoying it. We both started making music for Joyer without even considering playing shows or anything. We just wanted to make music. So the fact that people want to come out and watch us, it's nice enough.<br></br><b>Shane: </b>I feel like when we first started, not that many people would come out. So when people do, it feels really good and it still definitely feels kind of weird that the little amount of people that care even do care. It's nice and it makes playing a lot of fun.<br></br><em>Q: How does playing live differ from the recordings?</em><br></br><b>Shane: </b>Sometimes we're not really able to recreate everything that's on the recording just because we might use different instruments and layers of different instruments on the recordings that aren't really practical to play with live. But also, I think it's definitely fun to get the opportunity to play the song a different way or rework a song for the live set, just to keep it interesting and make the songs fun to play over and over.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>On the recordings, we play all the instruments, but when we play live, we have to find new people to play with and that always makes it different. We're always rotating and I'll play a different instrument depending on who we have to play with. So that changes things a lot. Sometimes we'll have a drummer who naturally plays louder, so we sound heavier, things like that.<br></br><em>Q: Joyer‚Äôs sound has become a bit more experimental on the latest album, ‚ÄòPerfect Gray.‚Äô What was the recording process for that like?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>We were just more prepared on that album. Every time we make a new album we know more and are more comfortable with what we're doing. We knew a lot more of what we wanted and learned a lot more about production and things like that. So when we went in, we had these ideas to make this song sound warped or we wanted to play around with this or that. Brad, who records and mixes us, is a genius. So we could just tell them we want something to sound a certain way and he'll work with us to get it, like even better than we thought it would be or what we were imagining.<br></br><b>Shane: </b>For that album we got to record some of the overdubs at home. So that gave us more time to add different layers of things that we might not have had the opportunity to do at the studio.<br></br><em>Q: What‚Äôs the best and worst thing about touring?</em><br></br><b>Shane: </b>We only just started doing real serious tours recently, but they've been a lot of fun and it's definitely been an amazing experience. I like traveling a lot, so it's naturally really fun for me. I guess that would be my favorite part is just seeing new places that I've never been to before. But with that there's also like a lot of driving involved. My least favorite part would be getting to go to these places, but not really being able to spend too much time in those places just cause we have to get to the venue and manage all of that.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>Yeah, I agree. My favorite part about touring is seeing new places, and my least favorite part about touring is not getting to see those places for very long because we have to leave and go to another place really fast.<br></br><em>Q: How do the instrumental songs come about?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>Our instrumental songs don't usually come about with the intention of them being instrumental to begin with. We just play around and then we're like, ‚ÄúSounds good!‚Äù Sometimes it's just like we made it so weird and kind of dumb that we don't think there could be vocals over it, but I end up liking them a lot more than I think I do, in retrospect.<br></br><em>Q: How does Joyer differ from slowcore bands in the 90‚Äôs?</em><br></br><b>Shane: </b>Recently I've been trying to get out of that a little bit just to try new things out. But I still love the spirit of that genre and those bands. I'll always be inspired by that kind of stuff, but also just in terms of playing live, it's been fun playing faster stuff just cause I guess the crowd seems to get more into it and it's easier to feed off of that.<br></br><b>Nick: </b>I don't necessarily think I want us to sound like the nineties or anything like that. I think a lot of bands that I like are from the nineties, not necessarily even like slowcore, but just indie or rap or electronic music or anything. So maybe it just naturally happens. But yeah I agree that we're slowcore, but I don't think that we always try to write like that or just be this has to be this way because it's slowcore.<br></br><em>Q: What‚Äôs next for Joyer?</em><br></br><b>Nick: </b>We have some shows and we're working on a new album, but it'll probably be a while. Go see Shep Treasure play soon too because they're a friend of the band.<br></br><b>Shane: </b>Yeah, Nick plays in that band, so that's why he's plugging it. All right. Thank you.`,

    content: `YHWH Nailgun is a tightly knit group of four. Zach writes the lyrics and sings the vocals. Jack plays the synth. He also runs the label <a href="https://domanisounds.bandcamp.com/"><u>Domani Sounds</u></a> and plays in the band Threesome. Sam plays the drums. He‚Äôs in the band <a href="https://godcaster.bandcamp.com/"><u>Godcaster</u></a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/boscomujo/"><u>BoscoMujo</u></a>, and has a solo project called <a href="https://beheadingsonline.bandcamp.com/album/bent-creature"><u>Beheadings Online</u></a>. Saguiv plays the guitar. Also a member of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bug_fight/?hl=en"><u>Bugfight</u></a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/assassin_of_you.th/?hl=en"><u>Assassin of Youth</u></a>. All four mention YHWH Nailgun as their main project.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>How did the band get together?</em><br></br><b>Sam</b>: We‚Äôve all known each other through music for several years, but YHWH Nailgun started when Zack and I lived together in Philly, and we decided to start a project where I was using Ableton - I was doing just electronic production stuff, and he was doing vocals. And yeah, ultimately we wanted to make it into a band and start using live instruments. We've known Jack for a long time and we hit him up and asked if he would play synth. And then we recorded our EP with Saguiv. He produced the whole thing, and since we were all friends with him and fans of his guitar playing, we had him join the band to play guitar, and the rest is history.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>How did your sparse, pared back sound develop?</em><br></br><b>Saguiv: </b>I guess I can't speak too much about the time before I joined, but at least from &nbsp;an outsider perspective from then and taking in the job for production. It‚Äôs a lot of organic sounds, kind of trying to mimic nature as much as you can with rock instruments, so to speak. There's no bass, but I guess the synth is taking over that plus higher register stuff. And then I joined and obviously I didn‚Äôt want to redirect the band in another direction, but just kind of reinforce what's already happening and see how we can push forward with the initial idea of where we want to go. So I started doing what Zach was already doing on guitar, he started doing the volume pedal thing and removing all the attack or peak noises. It's all swells. Little by little, we feel more comfortable, like dropping things that were there when we initially formed. Like there's a new song where there's no volume pedal or like Sam is thinking of dropping the metal ring on the drums. We call them the gimmicks. We're very critical about new ideas and very easily shut down ideas - we'll give them a shot, but we'll be like, okay, that sucks. Let's not do that. I'd say like seven, six out of ten ideas we're like, nah. But also very open to when something sounds good, it sounds good and doesn't really matter what it‚Äôs like.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>I think we approach practicing and the sound in a way that isn't necessarily industrial, but rather when we would rehearse, we were just like really in the sounds that we could make that wouldn't sound like the instrument necessarily. It‚Äôd be creatively directed by Zach's poetic descriptions of sounds like making something sound more lemony or making something sound like a water hose or something like that. I think we just like the sounds rather than trying to be experimental or something.<br></br><b>Sam: </b>I think also as a band, we don't really care that much about melodies. Here and there, there's little fragments of melodies that we try to incorporate. A big thing for us has been trying to use melodies almost like samples, where it's not really like a fully realized contour of a melody. It's just kind of like this little fragment. We‚Äôre mostly thinking about rhythm and sounds. Anything else we try to incorporate seems to get cast aside, like dead weight.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>How did the </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs4UyojW5PQ"><u><em>video</em></u></a><em> for ‚ÄúHawk Violence‚Äù come about?</em><br></br><b>Zach:</b> I filmed the TV from the Justin Cage Michael Chandler fight. It's a really great fight. It's such a good fight because they were just trading punches, and both of them have just a crazy chin, and so they're just bleeding, and they just kind of keep hitting each other over and over again. It's such a bizarre, over-the-top, masculine moment and it's situated in the most mundane, like guy culture ever. I guess there was something like that connected to the band.<br></br><b>Sam: </b>Yeah, we appreciate athleticism as a band. And excellence.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>We're all fixated on the body.<br></br><b>Sam:</b> That's true, too.The human body is an interest for sure.<br></br><b>Saguiv:</b> I think the video relates to how when Zach is doing his vocal deliveries, like the other day doing vocal overdubs, we were talking about the kind of the fluidity between the macho delivery and the more feminine delivery. Seeing how such a masculine thing like the fight, you know, people beating each other up can seem really homoerotic where they're hugging each other and borderline kissing. I think the back and forth between hitting each other into that weird, bizarre loving in the ring relates to the moments of violence and fragility in the music.<br></br><b>Zach: </b>There's like there's one shot where Michael Chandler is sitting down and his trainer or whatever they call that is trying to clean him up in between rounds, and he looks like a lamb, like bleeding and and and it's like close up on his face. He has this totally vulnerable look on his face. I guess something like the combination of those things is what attracted me to it.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>How do you decide when a song is a finished product?</em><br></br><b>Jack: </b>In rehearsals, we honestly write really well together, like insanely collaborative. It'll start with a lick or a sound that me, Saguiv or Sam will make, and then we just riff off of that. Definitely being guided by Zack in the practice space, I think. When there's multiple ideas that really make sense together it feels like a roller coaster to get to these ideas, but there's a time when it is finalized and we all kind of are looking at each other like ‚ÄúThis is it.‚Äù Some practices we've written like two songs. And others, we will take hours and hours to figure out one part.<br></br><b>Saguiv:</b> And then we scratch it.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>Yeah, and then we scratch it.<br></br><b>Saguiv: </b>We'll spend a lot of time with an idea and then if it's not working, it doesn't matter how long we spend on it. We're just like, nah, we‚Äôre good. Then for vocals, it's never really done until it's recorded or even maybe after. There is always room for change. You're constantly gauging how it feels.<br></br><b>Jack:</b> We have different roles in each song. Not just musical roles, but someone feels like the leader or something. We're recording an EP right now where compared to the first one, it is very different what our role is in each song.<br></br><b>Sam: </b>There's a good amount of stuff where there's not really any kind of harmonic anything going on as much as just rhythms. And they all just kind of like, interlock in a way that we like, and then we just kind of are like. Okay. That's a song. Yeah, we have a new song. You know.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>There's a confidence to it, though. Nobody is saying ‚ÄúOh, it doesn't feel full enough‚Äù, you know?<br></br><b>Sam: </b>It feels it takes very little to write a song for us, it takes very few moving parts before we feel like we're done with it.<br></br><b>Zach: </b>I think it's collaborative in a really fluid way. There's a lot of really natural push and pull that happens at the same time and everybody is equally engaged in it, which is a really exciting way to write because it just feels natural. We do that with the instrumentals and we just kind of like to play with something and then we talk about it and then we go through it and then eventually we get like an instrumental. And then once the instrumental is done, usually I'm like listening to an iPhone demo or something and I'm just always writing anyway, so I'll just usually just take things that I've already written and figure out a way to make it work. One thing I'm really happy about with the band is that it feels like everybody's kind of doing what they do in the way that they want to do it, and it naturally fits into one whole thing, which is cool.<br></br><b>Jack:</b> It really is like the most basic way to write music. None of us really come into practice or anything with an idea. It's like how anybody would imagine writing a song. It's how we write it where someone like Sam starts playing a beat and then I start playing on top of that. Or Saguiv comes up with something. It's really easy, and we're all really good at knowing what this web of YHWH Nailgun that we've created is. So I think we can kind of push the limits and do our own thing inside of this bubble of this idea that we've created over a long period of time. There's a lot of freedom to it.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>Talk more about your interest with the human body</em><br></br><b>Sam: </b>I think our music is heavily rhythmic and full of guttural sounds, and Zach makes a real effort to make his vocal performance very physical. He does a lot of contorting his body and placing himself in weird, unnerving poses live. I think a lot of the lyrics are around this sort of physicality.<br></br><b>Jack: </b>I think when we play live, the fact that Zach isn't holding an instrument we also, if we're lucky or I mean, we normally try to do this, but we play with the lights off and like a spotlight on Zach. To where you can see the three of us. But. It's almost like shining a light on Zach's like, you know, body in a way. It's super vulnerable and intimate, but it also kind of goes along with the same idea of the music video or anything like that.<br></br><em><b>Q: </b></em><em>There‚Äôs a lot of looping figures in your music, how do those come about?</em><br></br><b>Jack: </b>I think the loops come from how we come up with ideas in practice and then we almost loop the ideas and then that just kind of ends up being it. But we also talk about being inspired by techno and electronic music and stuff like that where there is that repetition.<br></br><b>Sam </b>I like to take one idea and just do it over and over and over again. It's in a lot of electronic music, and we all are fans of electronic music. You know, there's a lot of different stuff that I think we're drawing from in that sense, but also it just feels good to just play the same thing over and over again until it's just burning into your skull.<br></br><b>Saguiv:</b> How much you can squeeze out of one idea? Because also we're trying to not create too complicated song structures like the instrumental parts, except the drums are pretty intricate, but the songs are kind of simple, mostly like in 4/4. I don't want it to feel like there's like an A section and a B section of completely divorced ideas, but rather like a more fluid transition from one to the other. There should be kind of a new angle on the same kind of riff rather than presenting a new idea for the B section.`,

I started playing music for real in middle school when around the sixth or seventh grade I started playing drums, which I consider my first real instrument. I got pretty obsessed with playing drums and started a band with my friend that was just us trying to sound like Nirvana or Korn or something with absolutely no musical knowledge or ability. That was the first band I ever had, we were called S.O.S. I think one of our songs was called ‚ÄúClean Up Your Fucking Room.‚Äù<br></br>I think learning drums is a cool foundation to learn other instruments, having that rhythmic background I think is helpful. I remember finally learning how to play this really simple AC/DC beat, I remember that was a huge achievement for me. It took months and months of practice just to get the coordination to be able to do that.<br></br>Then I started wanting to make my own music and not just play drums. A few years after that, I started playing guitar and tried to learn covers, but I think it didn't really click until I realized guitar could just be anything you want it to be. I just started playing for fun and what sounded cool to me, I would play solos along to old disco and funk. From there, I just put in the time to start learning, and I picked up the keyboard too. I got into Philip Glass and the minimalist, kind of weird, Terry Riley keyboard stuff. I tried to make Steve Reich rip off music. I had a shitty Casio keyboard and somewhere along the line, all these different things kind of synthesized into Marshall Stacks and my other projects.<br></br><em>Q: You have two main monikers under which you‚Äôve released music recently: Cabanaman and Marshall Stacks. What‚Äôs the musical focus for both of these projects, and do you take a different approach when writing songs for each of them?</em><br></br>I've always made music by just jamming a lot and playing whatever sounds good to me at a given moment, and then from there, I'll see the direction that it takes me in and where that leads me. Once I see where it's headed is when I decide which project it's going to fall under. So it depends. The latest album <em>Marshall Law</em> I'm working on is more rock heavy and there are more songs that I've been coming up with over a long period of time, so that kind of came together in a more traditional songwriting style. But snXXXis was more on the experimental, free improv side of things.<br></br>Cabanaman was inspired by this chill out mix that my friend had a burned CD of when we were hanging out in New Jersey a few summers ago. It was this burned CD that just said ‚ÄúLibra Mix‚Äù of this really crazy chill out music. That was one of the sort of inspirations for Cabanaman was to make really out there, lounge chill out music ‚Äì sort of nineties, Pure Moods inspired but updated to the modern day.<br></br>I didn't want it to be just straight nineties, chill out. I wanted to imagine what chill out music would sound like in the modern era. It's a very different world than the world of the nineties when the original Chillout Lounge music came about. So I was like, ‚ÄúOkay, what does that sound like now?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat does that mean, given how the world has changed?‚Äù It's a very different outlook. There's all these horrifying things happening in the world now. Things are headed in a pretty grim direction ‚Äì obviously the pandemic and climate change and all these different things. I was just thinking, ‚ÄúWhat does Chill Out music sound like now updated into this like present day reality that maybe has a more bleak outlook than in the nineties, when people were maybe less aware of an imminent environmental catastrophe?‚Äù<br></br><em>Q: One of the elements that makes ‚ÄúThe Compound‚Äù flow so well is the repeated use of water sounds, most often heard on the interludes between each song, which are named ‚ÄúMara‚Äù I-VI. What is the significance of water for this album, and what does ‚ÄúMara‚Äù mean?</em><br></br>The inspiration for that was imagining a desert oasis or something. I lived in this town in the desert in California while I was recording this album. You would be out there in a very pretty barren landscape, then out of nowhere there would be this really lush oasis, with flowing water and palm trees. I think the structure of the album was imagining the water sounds you experience in an oasis in the interludes, but then the actual tracks are like you've left the oasis and you're back in the surrounding world and the reality of strip malls and highways. I imagine someone traveling or embarking on a journey, where each song is a different place. Once the song ends you get back to the oasis.<br></br>The name Mara comes from the oasis around the town that I was living in, it was called the Oasis of Mara. It was named by the Serrano who first settled the area and it means "the place of little springs and much grass." So that's where the name came from. The oasis was burned down by an arsonist while I was living out there.<br></br>A lot of the structure of the album was similar to the live sets that I play. I usually like to play a set that's just sort of continuous, with seamless transitions from one track to another. I guess the structure of the album is probably derived from that and would start off with more ambient water sounds and then go into the tracks. I've always liked the flow of albums that don't have starts and stops. With playing live it's not like, here's a song and then stop and then there's some banter. I'd rather let the focus be on the music rather than trying to comment on every song I'm playing. Some of my favorite music isn‚Äôt all spelled out for you, and lets you go to whatever place in your mind that the music takes you to.<br></br><custom id="cman-pic"></custom><br></br><em>Q: The only thing that accompanied you onstage was your guitar and your laptop. How do you feel performing solo affects your relationship with the audience?</em><br></br>I would love to start playing with a band again. When I first started playing Marshall Staxx shows in Chicago I did have a full band, but it became easier to be able to control all the sounds myself and have it sound specifically how I wanted it to sound. I grew up listening to hard rock and at a certain point I got more into electronic music and footwork and I think that expanded my mind in terms of what a live set could even be.<br></br>I think I got a little bored of the traditional rock setup. It just felt a little like, this is what a band has to sound like. It has to be guitar, bass, drums, maybe keyboard. Getting into electronic music was pretty inspirational to think that music can really be anything you want it to be. There's no limits on it. I wanted to incorporate that idea into the punk and hard rock background that I had and just ask, ‚ÄúOkay, how can we apply this cool futuristic way of making music to metal and heavy music that I grew up listening to?‚Äù<br></br>In the eighties, people thought by 2020 music was going to be so futuristic and alien and unimaginable. There's definitely a lot of pretty wild music out there now, but I feel like in terms of rock music, it hasn't really gotten there. I feel like some of my music was inspired by imagining what a band like Blue Oyster Cult or something in the 70‚Äôs would have thought rock music was going to sound like in 2022 ‚Äì like woah, it‚Äôs gonna be so crazy and unimaginable and alien and there's going to be all these technological advances. So I wanted my music to keep up with that and keep up with the technological pace that things are at. That was some of the idea behind Marshall Stacks.<br></br><em>Q: Both of your projects make use of guitar solos, but put them in unique contexts, like in the middle of a more ambient electronic section. What does a guitar solo mean to you, what interests you about them?</em><br></br>There is this Carl Craig album, <em>Landcruising</em>, that was pretty inspirational. It's really wild, techno futuristic music, and then at the end of the first track there's this guitar solo that comes in. It blew my mind. I think that really opened me up to think that you could have guitar solos over anything. Growing up in the punk scene, a lot of people were pretty anti-guitar solo. Guitar solos were looked at as a sort of cheesy thing, like you're seeing Aerosmith or whatever in an arena and it's like, okay, here‚Äôs the guitar solo. Before that became such a trope, guitar solos were from blues music and early rock and roll. It wasn‚Äôt cheesy at all. The solo is a place for the guitarist to kind of just go for it and freely express themselves with no limitations of song structure and to just shred and see where it takes you.
     But by the time I was born it was long past post-post-nu-metal, Guitar Center kind of cliche. Rock music had already become this parody of itself by the time I was even old enough to start playing music.<br></br>I think some of the music I wanted to make was a response to that, acknowledging it's rock music in this post-post-Nickelback reality. Acknowledging that and giving a wink to that. I'm not a revivalist. I'm not trying to act like I'm in the seventies or something because it's not, it's 2022. I wanted to give a wink to the Guitar Center tropes while still getting back to the root of what made guitar solos cool to begin with.<br></br><em>Q: When I saw you perform your Marshall Stacks show, you donned the minimal but effective costume of a white tank top and sunglasses. Do you see the man behind Marshall Stacks as more of a character than Cabanaman?</em><br></br>I wouldn‚Äôt say Marshall Stacks is a character per se. Maybe it‚Äôs an extension of myself or a way of allowing my imagination to take me where it will, but it was all just sort of a natural thing that emerged over many years of performing live. I think characters are really cool though. Characters help explore your imagination and take yourself to places you might not ordinarily go, under the guise of a pseudonym or something, while being able to explore new realities in this imagined mindset. I've always been drawn to people who, you know, they‚Äôre on stage, and there's kind of a character, but it's still just an extension of who they are as a person. It's not totally theatrical. I think when things get too theatrical I check out a little bit. But even like a band like Tad or something ‚Äì when they‚Äôre on stage, they‚Äôre just going for it. It's not so much a character, but you can tell, there's kind of a wink in their eyes. They know what they're doing. They‚Äôre maybe acting like a rock star dumbass, but you can tell they're actually a pretty intelligent person. They're doing it for the fun of it and to be entertaining. You want to see a spectacle if you're paying money to be at a show. I've never intentionally tried to do any of that, but playing shows over the years sort of led me to where I'm at now.<br></br><em>Q: What‚Äôs next for Marshall Stacks and Cabanaman? Any projects on the horizon? Any upcoming projects from other artists you‚Äôre excited about?</em><br></br>Yeah, I'm just finishing up the new Marshall Stacks album. <em>Marshall Law </em>is the new Marshall Stacks album, and it's some tracks I've been working on for quite a long time. It should be getting released this summer. That's the main thing that I'm focusing on. All of the tunes from that last live show are from the new album. I'd definitely love to play some more Cabanaman live shows soon too. I‚Äôm also about to release a reissue on Coolatta of a tape by my friend Jason Shapiro from Chicago, it‚Äôs really wild, catchy, nasty auto-tuned power pop kinda stuff. So lookout for that dropping soon.<br></br>Some other artists I‚Äôm psyched on - I‚Äôve been playing on some tracks from my friends‚Äô band The Sufis. I've been playing a little guitar on their stuff, I really dig their tracks, they‚Äôre like a psychedelic Bobby Caldwell or something. Keep a lookout for new music from them. My friend Harry, who plays as <a href="https://treatmentforu.bandcamp.com/"><u>Treatment</u></a>, he‚Äôs my guy. We've gone on some tours and I played a few solos on some of his tracks, I love his music. It‚Äôs sort of like sophisto-pop, New Jack Swing influenced. Shoutout to both of them. Also my friend Draye who played that show with me as <a href="https://mankindxx.bandcamp.com/releases"><u>Mankind</u></a> is super talented and is about to release some new music I‚Äôm really excited about.<br></br>Keep your eyes peeled for <em>Marshall Law</em>, the new Stacks album, coming out this summer! It‚Äôs been a long time in the making and I‚Äôm really psyched to finally get it out there.`,

    image: KIRA_THUMBNAIL,
    content: `<custom id="kira-vid"></custom><br></br>Kira McSpice lives in an ineffably charming cabin in Salem, NY. I had the pleasure of sitting down with her outside her home to talk about her recent four album series on the stages of the migraine. The filmed interview can be seen above, or, if you‚Äôd prefer, you can read the transcribed version below. Enjoy!<br></br>My name is Kira McSpice. I'm a singer songwriter from South Salem, New York. Over the past four years I've been working on a series called <em>The Migraine in Four Parts</em>. It follows the four stages of the migraine headache, going from <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/prodrome"><u>Prodrome</u></a>, to <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/aura"><u>Aura</u></a>, to <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/attack"><u>Attack</u></a> and finally to <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/attack"><u>Postdrome</u></a>.<br></br><em> <custom id="kira-pic-1"></custom> <br></br>Q: When you started this project, did you already know what you wanted each stage to sound like?</em><br></br>I wanted to put my favorite genres into each phase, and so <em>Aura</em> seemed like the perfect phase for ambient music. Of course the <em>Attack</em> phase had to be heavy and then <em>Prodrome</em> and <em>Postdrome</em> was everything else, like a hodgepodge of pop and folk and singer-songwriter music. I wanted each phase to sound like the symptoms in the migraine, so since <em>Aura</em> is super spacey and has a visual element, I created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPGzWoCrF0"><u>video</u></a> to go along with each song.<br></br><em>Q: Prodrome sounds like there‚Äôs something brewing, building up. On ‚ÄúUnchain,‚Äù for example, you sing, ‚ÄúEverything inside me knew there was something wrong.‚Äù Can you talk about what mood you wanted to set for that album?</em><br></br>During the <em>Prodrome</em> migraine phase there's this feeling of impending doom, so I wanted an anxiety present throughout <em>Prodrome</em> to make the listener feel like something bad was going to happen, and that <em>Attack</em> would eventually happen. I wanted to build tension throughout <em>Prodrome</em>, ending with the title track being this big explosion. It took me a while to sort out the tracklisting to see how much tension I could build. I just had to take some time organizing it and messing around with some of the songs.<br></br><em>Q: What were some things you learned about the stages of the migraine while working on this series?</em><br></br>Learning about the Prodrome was a very interesting thing for me, because not everybody realizes that they're having a Prodrome. Most people feel the Attack or they experience the Aura, the visual disturbances. But the prodrome is this quiet creeping thing - you just feel <em>off</em>. And I thought that was really interesting. Same with Postdrome, most people don't realize there is an after effect that can linger for a week even. Most people will say postdrome is a hangover of the migraine. But you can also feel very euphoric during it, which is why I have songs like ‚ÄúNeve‚Äù and ‚ÄúMirth,‚Äù which are hopeful because the series is ending and the migraine is ending, but also because of that euphoria that is present in the symptoms of Postdrome.<br></br>But yeah, of course, there is always going to be a sense of like, ‚ÄúOh, something's up‚Äù in my music because I can't just have it be happy for some reason, you know? I have to make it fucked up. And it is fucked up because the migrane will come back.<br></br><em><div align = "center"> <img height = "300" src= "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uLVjIFcnGNjJPvlx3uXOajdDy6oVDMuE" alt="drive image"/></div><p align = "center"> </p>Q: Do you feel like the migraine stages can relate to other processes in life?</em><br></br>Another big theme in the migraine series is mental illness. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 when the migraine series started and I was writing it. And so a lot of my frustrations with doctors and the stigma surrounding it kind of found its way into the music and became a big theme. It seemed like it fit well with the migraine because it‚Äôs cyclical. There‚Äôs mania and depression and it always comes back in sort of a cycle and the migraine of course has a cycle where it's eventually going to end and then you'll have another one someday. They're both disorders that you can't see. They're happening in your head, and so no one knows the amount of pain you're going through. They're also not very researched by doctors. There's not a lot of information on them, both mental illness and migraines.<br></br><em>Q: The four album covers of the migraine series are beautiful but starkly different than one another in appearance. How did you plan those out and what were you trying to communicate with them?</em><br></br>So the <em>Prodrome</em> and <em>Postdrome</em> covers are based on the hangman tarot card, which upright represents surrendering control to cycles and surrendering control in general. When it's reversed it means the opposite of that, so you don't want to give in to cycles and you're being stubborn.<br></br><em>Prodrome</em> is the reversed hangman tarot card. I started out the series being too controlling and kind of choking everything and just not really being able to go with the flow of things and not really being able to surrender myself to the cycle. I was really fighting my diagnosis and just fighting everything -- like nature -- I hate the wintertime and it makes me super depressed, and I was fighting that without thinking of how necessary it is to have death in the winter. And it's necessary to feel the depression so that I know how great life can feel. That's why <em>Postdrome</em> ends with the hangman in the correct position, because I've learned that at this point it's okay to surrender control and just kind of give in to the cycle because the bad feelings will end and you'll learn more. You'll become wiser when you surrender that control.<br></br>The album art for <em>Aura</em> was me kind of curled up into a ball, sort of shying away from that. With <em>Attack </em>my hands are bound and I'm being, like, burned by fire. So the migraine or like horrible depression or whatever it is is just happening, and there's nothing I can do.<br></br><em><div align = "center"> <img height = "300" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_cO-i-VKIV7vVGRpqY1m-5txE1qwOCL7" alt="drive image"/></div><br></br>Q: Out of the four projects, "Attack" stands out as the most aggressive, and it is also the only album featuring you screaming. What was it like to let loose like that?</em><br></br>I hadn't sung like that before<em> Attack</em>. That was the first time I had ever screamed. That was a lot of fun to learn how to do that, it felt super cathartic to just shriek feedback, and being able to scream a burden is just so fun to do, but it did take a minute to learn how to do it. I had to watch a lot of YouTube videos about how to scream. I still don't know if I'm doing it right, but I enjoy it!<br></br><em>Q: A big theme of this project is being physically impacted by something you cannot control, do you feel music can have the same effect?</em><br></br>I definitely want to get a reaction out of people when they listen. I do want someone to feel sad when I write a very sad song. I want them to feel that because I was feeling sad. I think it's a very cathartic thing for someone to really be able to listen to something and go into that world and cry if you need to. Or feel that loneliness or feel that depth of sadness. Like ‚Äú000‚Äù on <em>Prodrome</em>. That's like a really sad song where I was feeling really awful one day and wrote that and just sank into it. I would hope that maybe it helps people, but I don't know if something like <em>Attack</em> can help. I hope it can help if you're feeling a burden. To hear someone scream. I guess my hope is that it helps people feel that catharsis and that they're able to kind of sit in that world and say ‚ÄúYeah I really feel this way!‚Äù<br></br><em>Q: How do you feel different after finishing this project, and how do you feel the same?</em><br></br>The four albums have definitely changed me in several ways. I was going to Berklee School of Music for a couple years and left because it just wasn't for me. I wanted to start writing music and figured these four albums could be my schooling in a way, especially if I made them each very different with very different people every time. I thought I would learn a lot and I did. I learned so much about music, about writing songs, about working with different musicians and producers. I learned so fucking much and am so glad that I did it. But I also learned a lot about myself and how I write and how I need music to fill my life spiritually. I need to be able to transmute the feelings and the things that have happened in my life into art. It's like a form of therapy. I think with these four albums, I've realized that is something very important to me. I'm really grateful that I saw it through and finished it.<div align = "center"> <img height = "300" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bsl_sFSByNSDAMkwPdywcmUyLbjca1Ud" alt="drive image"/></div><p align = "center"> Photos By Christian Traver </p>`,

For a few minutes, the world is drowned out by soundwaves shaped to crash upon the ears like a perfect beach. I felt this elation when I first heard ‚ÄúBreathe In‚Äù by Frou Frou, a track about the same world-stopping phenomenon but pertaining to love. ‚ÄúAnd I'm high enough from all the waiting/To ride a wave on your inhaling'' is the moment singer Imogen Heap reaches love-induced ecstasy, and she takes us along for the ride. The blissful bassline that opens the track is the sound of FOMO, something you‚Äôd hear when passing a party you wish you‚Äôd been invited to. The lilting, saccharine guitar pulled straight from The Cure on the chorus heralds the moment you walk into the party and everybody cheers because you‚Äôre actually awesome and you proceed to have the best night ever. And with that Imogen successfully lures us into fantasy musicland, but there‚Äôs a reason it all seems too good to be true. Everything drops out at the bridge when Heap repeats ‚ÄúIs this it?‚Äù building tension anxiously until she eventually admits ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù The veil has dropped ‚Äì take a look at the lyrics and it‚Äôs clear Imogen‚Äôs infatuation is ill-guided, and likewise the fun little dream that plays in one‚Äôs head when this song is heard will <expandableText text="never happen" hiddenText="unless you're incredibly popular at parties"></expandableText>.

    content: `With the lavish reissue of Pavement‚Äôs final album <em>Terror Twilight</em> finally released, there is no better time to revisit the project. In truth, it's always been a difficult album for me to connect with despite my all too common fanaticism for the group. Much like the final albums from H√ºsker D√º or The Replacements, there is a felt difference between its content and the energy put into the recording. The newly matured songwriting doesn't mesh with a band holding back its loose and sophomoric charm, and the result feels more strung-out than suited-up.<br></br>I do want to stress that this album has some amazing moments.The alternate track listing from producer Nigel Godrich highlights the number of true-blue pop songs on the album by cramming them all into the more immediately accessible b-side. This new order doesn‚Äôt do much to improve the albums reputation, and like many retrospectives the constant tinkering might dull the albums magic. However, the uncharacteristically straightforward presentation of these songs does a lot more to clue us in on the state of the band at this time and helps us pick apart this obtuse record more thoroughly.<br></br>The first track of the b-side ‚ÄúBillie‚Äù features a mix of DNA between early pavement and what would eventually color the more heartfelt moments of Steven Malkmus‚Äô self-titled solo LP. Lyrically it marries the character study of ‚ÄúJenny And The Ess-Dog‚Äù with the free association of ‚ÄúSerpentine Pad.‚Äù Anchored around a prominent acoustic guitar, the song starts off slow enough before transitioning into full jam rock. The track keeps you on your toes without the feeling of annoyance that can often accompany this sort of aesthetic, and is probably a good introduction for those Pavement neophytes out there. I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to claim this is the best track on <em>Terror Twilight</em>, but it caught my attention this time around and certainly deserves more love.

Each band member wrote their own parts to the song without hearing the others‚Äô contributions ‚Äì a patchwork approach that results in several surprise turns, like when a dense clap sends the track into a paranoid, acoustic lo-fi swamp that‚Äôd make a good home for Radiohead. Murphy‚Äôs menacing vocals of the past have morphed into something more frightened; his voice swirls untethered as he accepts his fate: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never see the boys again / Cause I‚Äôm off to the funny farm.‚Äù ‚ÄúDrink The New Wine‚Äù is an anti-anthem, an omen crafted by a band ready to step out of the shadows.`,

For as long as I have been listening to music it seems as if the songs on <em>It‚Äôs a Shame About Ray</em>, which recently turned 30,<em> </em>are in a constant state of rediscovery. The strength and timelessness of these songs seem to offhandedly mirror whatever you throw at them, and practically every guitar based pop movement in the last decade has made strides to claim them as a result. The second track off the album, ‚ÄúConfetti‚Äù, is today's song of the day purely because it‚Äôs the cut off the album most often stuck in my head. Featuring all vibes and little to no substance, this track manages to nail the summery power pop hooks the Lemonheads were so good at without any of the structural baggage some other cuts have. The video is interesting in that low effort - listless band playing to a background b-plot unrelated to the song - kind of 90‚Äôs thing.

    content: `Wire‚Äôs first album <em>Pink Flag </em>is seminal because it takes a handful of simple tools ‚Äì guitars made of sandpaper, rapid, ladder-like chants, cryptic lyrics ‚Äì and smashes them together to form economic punk songs, with the mission to discover new ways to shape an anthem. Their follow-up <em>Chairs Missing </em>eclipses <em>Pink Flag </em>by toying with not only song structure, but <em>mood</em>. An obvious example is ‚ÄúI Feel Mysterious Today,‚Äù a lurking, drumless creeper of a track fit for dark alleys. "I Am The Fly" kicks the cosplay up a notch with a character study on the household's most infamous pest ‚Äì shrill guitars flit around honey-trapped synth, while singer Colin Newman fully inhabits the insect‚Äôs role: ‚ÄúI am the fly in the ointment/I can spread more disease than the fleas.‚Äù ‚ÄúI Am The Fly‚Äù becomes an anthem in its own right despite the repulsive subject matter; the song is a precursor to the seriously taken piss-takes of 90‚Äôs ironic indie rock.`,

His upcoming album <em>Boat Songs</em> is shaping up to be quite an exciting release. Lenderman excels at painting vividly empathetic and humane characters with his off-kilter brand of Americana, and newest single ‚ÄúTLC Cagematch‚Äù does all that and more, handling the image of an aging professional wrestler with grace and confidence.

    content: `‚ÄúJohn Henry‚Äù is a folk song gone wrong. The track is fashioned from the traditional Scots ballad ‚ÄúLass of Roch Royal,‚Äù with original lyrics that tell the tall tale of the steel driver <a href="https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/the-legend-of-john-henry-talcott-wv.htm"><u>John Henry</u></a> ‚Äì an American legend who bested a steam drill in a competition at the price of his own life. ‚ÄúJohn Henry‚Äù starts menacingly enough, with a dark drone and an autoharp played nervously. But as singer Marion Coutts plows through the verses, the song‚Äôs sanity is chipped away at more and more with loopy percussion, chunks of sparking guitar, and a wiry fiddle desperate to keep grasp of the track‚Äôs folksy roots. Coutts finishes the tale with the death of Henry on the mountain, mimicked by the song‚Äôs rapid acceleration like the last furious heartbeats of the overworked steel driver, and then the inevitable slowdown and collapse. ‚ÄúJohn Henry‚Äù is able to deconstruct folk song structure while staying true to the oft-told legend behind the lyrics.`,

    content: `My Dad is Dead‚Äôs most recognized album <em>Let‚Äôs Skip the Details </em>is a notably dark and inhospitable work even within the realm of post punk. As the title suggests, one of the work's main preoccupations is the many ways in which communication can fail us, and how attempts at mutual understanding can further isolate. Album opener ‚ÄúBaby‚Äôs Got a Problem‚Äù is the greatest statement in this regard. By dancing around the true nature of our subject‚Äôs wounds, project frontman Mark Edwards dwells on the intangible ways that past trauma stays with us and affects our future relationships. Heavy stuff. The album is also notable for beefing up the group from a solo project to a full backing band, and the sound benefits greatly from it. <em>Let‚Äôs Skip the Details </em>dwells between the abrasive bile of Big Black and the more accessible jangle projects of R.E.M. and Camper Van Beethoven, and as a result, Mark Edwards makes damage sound pretty damn captivating.`,

For my money, bands like Nothing and DIIV take a lot more from this sound than the usual suspects, MBV and Slowdive. One of Catherine Wheel‚Äôs signature songs, ‚ÄúCrank‚Äù was almost the title track to their second and most popular album <em>Chrome</em>. One listen and you can hear why, this is easily the most accessible and instantly gratifying cut on the album. ‚ÄúCrank‚Äù takes the band's heavier fixations and drapes them over smoldering power pop to create true bliss; the leanness and utility of its composition is something to marvel at.`,

    content: `I would like to continue the thread of yesterday's unnoticed anthem by introducing a track that did find its audience. ‚ÄúDo You Remember The First Time?‚Äù remains one of Pulps signature tracks, the second single off of their breakthrough album <em>His ‚Äòn‚Äô Hers</em>. By the time of their success, Jarvis Cocker had been in Pulp for half of his life. A picture is painted of a botched first sexual experience, and the jealousies and desires ‚Äì both realized and incomplete ‚Äì that spring from that instance. By looking back on an era of youthful inexperience with world weariness and acidity, ‚ÄúDo You Remember The First Time?‚Äù ties off the band's first fifteen years with a ribbon. Regardless of how petulant the subject matter is, though, the track‚Äôs soaring and intimate chorus has an unmet verve that sends me into hysterics almost three decades later. Jarvis Cocker would deliver more refined anthems in later albums, but the scrappier package has an underdog appeal that, at least sentimentally, reaches the heights of later achievements.`,

They were the first band to sign to Kitchenware, the label home to Prefab Sprout, and it‚Äôs clear the two bands were cut from similar cloths: the lead singer for Hurrah! (Paul Handyside) carries much of the same emotional affect in his voice as Prefab‚Äôs singer Paddy McAloon. But Hurrah! never quite saw the success of Prefab Sprout and their material is quite tough to find on online streaming. One song of theirs that I was able to discover is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOybuxbL104"><u>‚ÄúLet It Be Her‚Äù</u></a> from 1989. The track‚Äôs built on pretty standard jangle-pop guitars, backed by chugging strums that conjure the same tone as overdone smolder on the album‚Äôs cover. But the pre-chorus uses the same bold, ringing chord as one of Prefab Sprout‚Äôs most overlooked tracks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVoJDXdDgLU"><u>‚ÄúThe Golden Calf,‚Äù</u></a> while chorus is a powerhouse in its own: Handyside wails ‚ÄúPlease let it be her‚Äù like it‚Äôs a rollercoaster, launching the song to new anthemic heights.

OR if you want to watch the full, uncut interview check it out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWTFYfNMmY"><u>YouTube</u></a>!<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>Welcome to the show Angel! Really excited to have you here ‚Äì when Eternal Home came out it really blew me away. You have had quite a few solo projects but now it seels Fire Toolz have become one of your main focuses. What was the genesis of the fire toolz moniker -- what were your goals for the project, and how did you come up with the name itself?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> It‚Äôs hard to find a starting point, because really the starting point is like the big bang and &nbsp;everything just kind of comes after the thing before. I have been playing music forever. I guess I can say that when I started using computers to help me make electronic music is probably when fire toolz started to come more into focus. Because I was playing in bands with guitar, drums, etc. for a long time and then I got really into noise music in the late 2000‚Äôs. I was already playing acoustic solo music at the time but the noise stuff really inspired me and made me feel a lot more creative when it came to making solo music. So I was doing a lot more of that with hands on stuff and pedals and electronics of various kinds.The possibilities were truly endless when it came to computers. I was doing a combination of chillwave and trance and ambient music and stuff akin to 80‚Äôs pop. But then I was listening to more noise with vocals attached to it. Abstract vocals stuff like Wolf Eyes and Russian Tsarlag which was very folky but avant garde with weird vocals. I started making stuff like that using computers and just put improvised vocals over it. I was using a different moniker but changed the name to Fire-Toolz on the following album and the music started becoming a bit more structured and less nihilistic. That has taken me to where I am today.<br></br><br></br>I love the instant gratification of making music on a computer. It really beats writing a song on a guitar and rehearsing it and practicing for months before maybe playing a show. I can sit in my room for months all day long and not even have them written. The name Fire-Toolz came from an early internet terrorism tool, like mailbombing and pinging IP addresses to slow their connections and fishing tools that would constantly try new passwords until it guessed them ‚Äì really bad stuff. I didn‚Äôt use them much but I was constantly fascinated by those kinds of tools that these young anarchistic programmers would make and release. I remember Fire Tools was for AOL but I added the ‚Äòz‚Äô and ‚Äò-‚Äô. Unfortunately the creator struggled with a whole lot of trauma and mental illness and passed away a long time ago. When I started looking into it I felt kind of exploitative and wasn‚Äôt sure I still wanted to use this name. You know like the way people are with serial killers where they do terrible things and get propped up as icons? I didn‚Äôt want to do that here but I love the 90‚Äôs aesthetic, the whole cyberpunk thing; that's why I use it. I think its silly and the music doesn't quite fit as much but I have grown attached to it and love it.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>Yeah I personally love the name. When I hear the name Fire-Toolz it reminds me of the tools you would use to make a fire and I think your music has all these different elements that come together to make something pretty explosive and fiery.</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> There is a company called fire tools in Germany and I am surprised they have never bothered me about the name. When you go on twitter and don't use the underscore you will go to their Twitter. I am sure they know about me because the only three things on the internet with that name at this point are me, the hacking program and that company. I thought it would be cool to have a collaboration, like a fire poker with my logo on it. I might ask them about that someday.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>So one of my favorite things about the Fire-Toolz aesthetic is that most of the vocals are screaming, regardless of the other sounds surrounding you. Was there a moment where you decided that would be the main aesthetic or was that more natural?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> I don't really know why I started doing that ‚Äì I am a singer. I have sung in a lot of bands, some with harsh vocals. I think it was that I really liked the idea of combining screaming with music you might not hear it over. I really like early emo and screamo. What I really love about those bands is that there will be extremely mellow bits with intense screaming on top of that. Even though my music is more aggressive I just really love that pairing. I am singing a bit more now and I just recorded a track the other day that was only singing. I am starting to branch out a bit more now. But it was just what I needed and wanted to do at the time. I really love bands like Skinny Puppy and bile and the remixed old fear factory tunes that are out there. So I really love screaming with electronic music . It‚Äôs also easy, I don‚Äôt need to come up with melodies, it's just kind of like static noise that I can put over anything and it‚Äôs easy to mix. So there are a lot of reasons. I am sure I am going to keep doing it, though I will start singing a lot more as well.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b><em> That is one of the coolest parts of the project. On ‚ÄúYearning = Alchemical Fire‚Äù you‚Äôre screaming in that but it‚Äôs a danceable beat. I could imagine it being on in a club. I think in this project which sound more direct with a straightforward song structure. Was that intentional when putting together this album?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> No. I just kind of start with a sound and the songs start to write themselves. So some of them come out a little more pop oriented and some of them come out quite the opposite. I mean I like pop structures, the verse chorus verse chorus kind of thing, I grew up on that. But there's never a moment when I think ‚ÄúI should write a pop song.‚Äù I just start messing around with a synth or a noise and it just happens.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>I do think there's a really cool balance between songs that have a more coherent structure versus others that are more amorphous, or songs like ‚Äú--&gt; ¬∂rogressive --&gt; ¬∂ath --&gt;", which are more just like a sound collage. What do you think would be missing if you mashed together an EP of the most straightforward songs?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> Well I've never wanted to do that. I have had that idea proposed to me. When I was talking to my label I was given the idea that I should have some genre oriented EP‚Äôs, the metal oriented one the jazz one, etc.. But that's not who I am. That doesn‚Äôt reflect anything in my life at all. My life is full of, and seems to require, all these elements fusing together. I am not interested in focusing right now, I am in this mode of anything goes. It's not random, it's not like it's not intentional. The idea might be spontaneous. I might be working on a song and it has a beat and a chorus, and I just decide that I should add a wall of noise here. That's just how it happens. I don't have any interest in organizing things too much. I have this EP <em>I Can't Die</em>, and it has a straight up rock song, like how I wish Rush sounded these days. But I was like OK, I need some balance here. So track two is this weird drone noise thing. I like throwing people off like that. I like to disrupt their experience. You thought you were listening to a prog rock record, well, now you have to listen to 6 minutes of something where you dont know what's going on ‚Äì you don't know when it's going to kick in and it never does. It‚Äôs anarchy in a way. It is just what I do. I might get sick of it one day. I thought I would have by now, but I haven't.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b><em> You‚Äôve talked about how Fire-Toolz being a reflection of yourself, even like a diary. Do you think including these more confusing sections reflects your mental space?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> Absolutely. Life is not a genre. In the course of one day we can go from grief and suicide ideation to pure joy. We can have days where everything goes right or days where everything seems to go wrong. There are unexpected turns constantly. Because Fire-Toolz is a documentation of my spiritual development and psychological evolution it wouldn't make sense to try and make a certain kind of music. Right now I want to become more in touch with who I am and I want to become more integrated into the world in ways that make me feel safe and ways I can help people and help myself. If I want to reflect that in my music, it would be just stupid to stick to one sound.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>The first line on the album - ‚ÄúThese rocks absolutely must become jewels by first light tomorrow‚Äù feels like this anxiety about getting things completed or working on mental health. You must be really busy completing your music and working with </em><a href="https://www.angelhairaudio.com/"><u><em>Angel Hair Studios</em></u></a><em>. What does that line signify to you?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel: </b>Well, you‚Äôre very close. I don‚Äôt know, you‚Äôre kind of spot on, but it‚Äôs not really a statement about getting things done in life. I don't really have a problem with that. I‚Äôve always had a drive and been able to work really hard. It is more like my own refinement and development as a person, working through my trauma and working past things that I get stuck on psychologically. It is sort of this insistence and I guess healing and getting past things. I am really impatient a lot of times because sometimes when I've been working for so long and I still have these troubles and I‚Äôm just like - ‚Äúcome on!‚Äù. &nbsp;The song <a href="https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/track/where-on-earth-is-my-sacchid-nanda"><u>‚ÄúWhere On EARTH Is My SacchidƒÅnanda?‚Äù</u></a> &nbsp;is basically elaborating on that. All the lyrics are kind of this whiny sort of entitled perspective where I am just like - I have done all this work where is my peace where is my healing? I have worked so hard! I demand it now. I am not going to work any longer.<br></br><br></br>But yeah that line reflects an experience in my childhood where I got this thing called a <expandableText text="rock tumbler" hiddenText="I too got a rock tumbler and had a very similar experience to Angel"></expandableText>. I got really excited because the front of the box has these shiny looking jems and I wanted to make them. I set it up and was reading the box and found out it would take weeks. The idea of waiting for that long, it caused me this inner pain. I didn‚Äôt want to deal with all this time passing. It seemed very hard. My dad told me this story about when he was in the Navy and was writing my mom letters and they would take weeks to get to her. He would be expressing where he was in the moment but by the time they would get to her he would be in a completely different place. He told me that at the time to sort of console and help me and just say ‚ÄúLook this is how life is, you kind of need to be patient to get the best result.‚Äù<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>As the album reaches its second half it becomes a bit more nebulous. There are these bursts of energy around these more amorphous sections. This got me wondering about how you put together the tracklisting, were you trying to take the listeners on a particular journey?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel: </b>Like a lot of things in my music it feels like they happen by themselves or they put themselves together. I guess you could say I feel like a robot or a computer program that is set up by a higher entity. So really with the track order I was just trying to think of a cool order. I kept scooting songs around to find what feels good. One thing that was really intentional was putting the song ‚ÄúThick_flowy_glowy_sparkly_stingy_pain.mpeg‚Äù right next to &nbsp;‚ÄúWhere On EARTH Is My SacchidƒÅnanda?‚Äù because I thought it would be really cool to have this section where it is just drums, bass, guitar and making the industrial and glitchy elements take a backseat for a bit.<br></br>So the peaks and valleys are sort of intentional. But believe it or not I didn't just sit there and plan it out. I also had it in mind that this was going on vinyl. I had to make sure these 4 sections are gonna fit on a side of vinyl, so that did play a role. I am not good at concept albums because I am not good at planning something and following through exactly what I planned. I actually hate doing that, it‚Äôs very limiting. I want to let life blow my sailboat around.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker: </b><em>So I do like a lot of the song titles, and one of them in particular sounded like a video game title - ‚ÄúAwakening Fantasy‚Ñ¢ 2.‚Äù I was wondering if you played any video games ofr if that influenced any of Eternal Home.</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> I love videogames but I never play them. I don't really enjoy playing them but I do like watching friends play them. I mostly hate violent video games, but if it's really fantasy or sci-fi I can deal with a little violence. I enjoy Super Mario World and that shit‚Äôs violent. I did play Super Mario and Metroid as a kid. Video game music definitely inspires me. I have an SNES and an NES and I want to try and get the games I got as a kid. I am just not into them the way some of my friends are. The word ‚Äòawakening‚Äô in the title is referring to a spiritual awakening of sorts, a psychological breakthrough. The ‚Ñ¢ refers to the commercialization of spiritual learning and teachers. I don't really have a problem with that sort of thing because I have bought many of those courses. I love spiritual teachers. But the lyrics are about my idolizing and romanticizing the process of spiritual awakening instead of a more authentic experience. The word fantasy refers to me fantasizing about those breakthroughs. The ‚Äò2‚Äô is there because I have used the title in an earlier project and wanted to use it again.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> So in two different songs these two characters pop up - the scientist and the mystic - on "Umbilical Cord Blood" you talk about them having an ‚Äúawkward dinner date.‚Äù What do they represent to you?<br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> It's a huge theme in my psychological exploration. They refer to an inner child and an inner adult. I am a scientist mystic ‚Äì you would think these things would be two opposites and they kind of are. My life's journey is integrating them. There are some huge mystics who ignore practicality and logic, and those who are so about logic and science that are black or white thinkers who deny the existence of whatever they can't measure. I very strongly have both of these things always on fire within me- I think they fit together perfectly like yin and yang ‚Äì but being conditioned by our culture, there‚Äôs so much of a war in between them. I‚Äôm learning new ways to get them to work together. And if you think about it like inner child and inner adult, the inner adult is the scientist ‚Äì telling my inner child to stop crying, to get into line ‚Äì and my inner child needs support and love.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>So I do think there is a kind of virtuosity to this music, some really cool, unique chords. I know you‚Äôve collabed with Adam Neely, who‚Äôs all about the music theory. Do you think a lot about theory when writing songs or is it more about what sounds cool?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> Well this is a good example of a scientist mystic type thing. I do love theory, and I love Adam Neely so much, he‚Äôs such a sweetheart. I love his YouTube channel, and I wish I knew a fraction of what he knows about theory. But the mystic metaphor comes in because I am just doing what sounds good, weird, or interesting. I would say a portion of my music has theory in mind, I intentionally want to use certain chords that bring up certain feelings in me. I really take a lot of tips from jazz fusion and second wave emo because they put a lot of focus on dissonance. But I‚Äôm not like ‚ÄòI need to sit down and write something in harmonic minor.‚Äô So I would say it‚Äôs mostly based on feeling but knowing some theory is really helpful because I use it to evoke the feeling I‚Äôm going for.<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>Last question: So obviously the album deals a lot about the concept of home, considering the title itself is Eternal Home. What does the concept of home mean to you, in general?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel:</b> Well there‚Äôs a lot of different ways you can interpret the word home and they‚Äôre all part of the title. If we‚Äôre just talking about where we live physically, that type of home has always been so important to me. It‚Äôs my home base, it‚Äôs where I feel safe and the most inspired. As you can see by my surroundings, it‚Äôs like I puked my inner self all over my walls. I have cat posters, brightly colored tapestries everywhere. And for awhile I was really struggling feeling at home and settled because I knew that most of these places I was living were not permanent. I find a lot of comfort in the idea of permanence but there‚Äôs no such thing as permanent. So I‚Äôve had to really do a lot of work to settle in and relax in a temporary space. So the reason why the last part of the album is titled ‚Äòhome for now‚Äô is because I was talking to a friend of mine who said my space is ‚Äòmy home for now.‚Äô That really just struck me because I realized I can relax completely into this space because it is my home <em>for now</em>, and when that changes I can worry about it then. It seems really simple but there was a shift within me when that was able to click.<br></br><br></br>But zooming out to the eternal part, home is really just your existence ‚Äì that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre seated, there‚Äôs no such thing as not being home. &nbsp;Anytime you feel like you‚Äôre not home, it‚Äôs an illusion - if you can just get in touch with your inner home, there‚Äôs a real sense of comfort and relaxation that can come about. I could go into a bunch of different theologies from spiritual traditions to explain this, but I won‚Äôt do that. The idea of home is a very spiritual thing as much as a physical thing for me. I struggled a lot coming up with a title, but one day I was just like ‚Äúah that‚Äôs it.‚Äù<br></br><br></br><b>Parker:</b> <em>Any projects on the horizon you want to shout out?</em><br></br><br></br><b>Angel: </b>I have a series on YouTube called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5cRRlxdns4&amp;t=37s"><u>‚ÄúBehind The Muzak,‚Äù</u></a> where I answer fans‚Äô questions about my work. I just released an <em>Eternal Home </em>Behind the Muzak episode ‚Äì I asked people on my Instagram stories to ask me questions about <em>ET </em>&nbsp;and I filmed myself answering all the questions. I also just finished working on a video for ‚ÄúOdd Cat Sanctuary.‚Äù I would really love it if people <expandableText text="subscribed" hiddenText="Her videos are top notch! highly recommend"></expandableText> to my YouTube channel, because I have this weird desire to do the Youtuber thing. I also post stuff on Instagram and have a mailing list.`,

    content: `This is a serious problem I‚Äôm not joking. Every time I pull out my laptop and try to write (which is definitely every day because I definitely am a very productive individual) I inevitably hear the trademark electronic gurgles that set up Smashing Pumpkins‚Äô second best song ‚Äú1979.‚Äù &nbsp;I may not know how my finger landed on the play button but I certainly can‚Äôt prevent it once it starts -- the slicked-down mid-90‚Äôs indie rock strums are so very irresistible. I blame Ben for issuing an ultimatum at the record store I work at: he would either leave or I would play Corgin‚Äôs spiritual successor to Sonic Youth‚Äôs ‚ÄúTeenage Riot.‚Äù It‚Äôd been bouncin‚Äô around the ol‚Äô brain for the past few days as a result of its baffling inclusion on <expandableText text="my work's" hiddenText="Not the record store but the BBQ joint I work at - it's New York I have three jobs"></expandableText> ‚Äú60‚Äôs And 70‚Äôs Popular Rock‚Äù playlist, so I had no problem relenting to Ben‚Äôs demand.<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></br>The Pumpkins‚Äô ode to fading youth soundtracked my life nonstop for the following week, but that was only the beginning. Before long my addiction extended to all of the tracks on <em>Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> ‚Äî I played "Tonight, Tonight" about twenty times to dramatize my trips to the laundromat, and I couldn‚Äôt stop binging the record‚Äôs unimpeachable row of ballads that populate the second half. How am I supposed to write when I could instead succumb to the sweet drawl of ‚ÄúLily My One and Only‚Äù or get swept up in the psychedelic tide of ‚ÄúPorcelina Of The Vast Oceans?‚Äù<br></br><br></br>I let myself get captured by the siren songs of <em>Melon Collie</em> because I like to follow the implicit advice of ‚Äú1979‚Äù and enjoy the rush while it lasts. When you come across an album you just can't peel your ears away from, lean into it. Because after all, one day we'll all turn to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aeETEoNfOg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dust</a> I guess.`,
