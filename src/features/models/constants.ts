    title: 'An Interview With Kira McSpice',
    author: 'Parker Albert',

    content: `<custom id="kira-vid"></custom><br></br>Kira McSpice lives in an ineffably charming cabin in Salem, NY. I had the pleasure of sitting down with her outside her home to talk about her recent four album series on the stages of the migraine. The filmed interview can be seen above, or, if you’d prefer, you can read the transcribed version below. Enjoy!<br></br>My name is Kira McSpice. I'm a singer songwriter from South Salem, New York. Over the past four years I've been working on a series called <em>The Migraine in Four Parts</em>. It follows the four stages of the migraine headache, going from <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/prodrome"><u>Prodrome</u></a>, to <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/aura"><u>Aura</u></a>, to <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/attack"><u>Attack</u></a> and finally to <a href="https://kiramcspice.bandcamp.com/album/attack"><u>Postdrome</u></a>.<br></br><em> <custom id="kira-pic-1"></custom> <br></br>Q: When you started this project, did you already know what you wanted each stage to sound like?</em><br></br>I wanted to put my favorite genres into each phase, and so <em>Aura</em> seemed like the perfect phase for ambient music. Of course the <em>Attack</em> phase had to be heavy and then <em>Prodrome</em> and <em>Postdrome</em> was everything else, like a hodgepodge of pop and folk and singer-songwriter music. I wanted each phase to sound like the symptoms in the migraine, so since <em>Aura</em> is super spacey and has a visual element, I created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPGzWoCrF0"><u>video</u></a> to go along with each song.<br></br><em>Q: Prodrome sounds like there’s something brewing, building up. On “Unchain,” for example, you sing, “Everything inside me knew there was something wrong.” Can you talk about what mood you wanted to set for that album?</em><br></br>During the <em>Prodrome</em> migraine phase there's this feeling of impending doom, so I wanted an anxiety present throughout <em>Prodrome</em> to make the listener feel like something bad was going to happen, and that <em>Attack</em> would eventually happen. I wanted to build tension throughout <em>Prodrome</em>, ending with the title track being this big explosion. It took me a while to sort out the tracklisting to see how much tension I could build. I just had to take some time organizing it and messing around with some of the songs.<br></br><em>Q: What were some things you learned about the stages of the migraine while working on this series?</em><br></br>Learning about the Prodrome was a very interesting thing for me, because not everybody realizes that they're having a Prodrome. Most people feel the Attack or they experience the Aura, the visual disturbances. But the prodrome is this quiet creeping thing - you just feel <em>off</em>. And I thought that was really interesting. Same with Postdrome, most people don't realize there is an after effect that can linger for a week even. Most people will say postdrome is a hangover of the migraine. But you can also feel very euphoric during it, which is why I have songs like “Neve” and “Mirth,” which are hopeful because the series is ending and the migraine is ending, but also because of that euphoria that is present in the symptoms of Postdrome.<br></br>But yeah, of course, there is always going to be a sense of like, “Oh, something's up” in my music because I can't just have it be happy for some reason, you know? I have to make it fucked up. And it is fucked up because the migrane will come back.<br></br><em><div align = "center"> <img height = "300" src= "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uLVjIFcnGNjJPvlx3uXOajdDy6oVDMuE" alt="drive image"/></div><p align = "center"> </p>Q: Do you feel like the migraine stages can relate to other processes in life?</em><br></br>Another big theme in the migraine series is mental illness. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 when the migraine series started and I was writing it. And so a lot of my frustrations with doctors and the stigma surrounding it kind of found its way into the music and became a big theme. It seemed like it fit well with the migraine because it’s cyclical. There’s mania and depression and it always comes back in sort of a cycle and the migraine of course has a cycle where it's eventually going to end and then you'll have another one someday. They're both disorders that you can't see. They're happening in your head, and so no one knows the amount of pain you're going through. They're also not very researched by doctors. There's not a lot of information on them, both mental illness and migraines.<br></br><em>Q: The four album covers of the migraine series are beautiful but starkly different than one another in appearance. How did you plan those out and what were you trying to communicate with them?</em><br></br>So the <em>Prodrome</em> and <em>Postdrome</em> covers are based on the hangman tarot card, which upright represents surrendering control to cycles and surrendering control in general. When it's reversed it means the opposite of that, so you don't want to give in to cycles and you're being stubborn.<br></br><em>Prodrome</em> is the reversed hangman tarot card. I started out the series being too controlling and kind of choking everything and just not really being able to go with the flow of things and not really being able to surrender myself to the cycle. I was really fighting my diagnosis and just fighting everything -- &nbsp;like nature -- I hate the wintertime and it makes me super depressed, and I was fighting that without thinking of how necessary it is to have death in the winter. And it's necessary to feel the depression so that I know how great life can feel. That's why <em>Postdrome</em> ends with the hangman in the correct position, because I've learned that at this point it's okay to surrender control and just kind of give in to the cycle because the bad feelings will end and you'll learn more. You'll become wiser when you surrender that control.<br></br>The album art for <em>Aura</em> was me kind of curled up into a ball, sort of shying away from that. With <em>Attack </em>my hands are bound and I'm being, like, burned by fire. So the migraine or like horrible depression or whatever it is is just happening, and there's nothing I can do.<br></br><em><div align = "center"> <img height = "300" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_cO-i-VKIV7vVGRpqY1m-5txE1qwOCL7" alt="drive image"/></div><br></br>Q: Out of the four projects, "Attack" stands out as the most aggressive, and it is also the only album featuring you screaming. What was it like to let loose like that?</em><br></br>I hadn't sung like that before<em> Attack</em>. That was the first time I had ever screamed. That was a lot of fun to learn how to do that, it felt super cathartic to just shriek feedback, and being able to scream a burden is just so fun to do, but it did take a minute to learn how to do it. I had to watch a lot of YouTube videos about how to scream. I still don't know if I'm doing it right, but I enjoy it!<br></br><em>Q: A big theme of this project is being physically impacted by something you cannot control, do you feel music can have the same effect?</em><br></br>I definitely want to get a reaction out of people when they listen. I do want someone to feel sad when I write a very sad song. I want them to feel that because I was feeling sad. I think it's a very cathartic thing for someone to really be able to listen to something and go into that world and cry if you need to. Or feel that loneliness or feel that depth of sadness. Like “000” on <em>Prodrome</em>. That's like a really sad song where I was feeling really awful one day and wrote that and just sank into it. I would hope that maybe it helps people, but I don't know if something like <em>Attack</em> can help. I hope it can help if you're feeling a burden. To hear someone scream. I guess my hope is that it helps people feel that catharsis and that they're able to kind of sit in that world and say “Yeah I really feel this way!”<br></br><em>Q: How do you feel different after finishing this project, and how do you feel the same?</em><br></br>The four albums have definitely changed me in several ways. I was going to Berklee School of Music for a couple years and left because it just wasn't for me. I wanted to start writing music and figured these four albums could be my schooling in a way, especially if I made them each very different with very different people every time. I thought I would learn a lot and I did. I learned so much about music, about writing songs, about working with different musicians and producers. I learned so fucking much and am so glad that I did it. But I also learned a lot about myself and how I write and how I need music to fill my life spiritually. I need to be able to transmute the feelings and the things that have happened in my life into art. It's like a form of therapy. I think with these four albums, I've realized that is something very important to me. I'm really grateful that I saw it through and finished it.<div align = "center"> <img height = "300" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bsl_sFSByNSDAMkwPdywcmUyLbjca1Ud" alt="drive image"/></div><p align = "center"> Photos By Christian Traver </p>`,

    content: `Anyone who’s ever listened to music knows that golden moment when a song first enters their awareness and immediately becomes the only thing that matters. For a few minutes, the world is drowned out by soundwaves shaped to crash upon the ears like a perfect beach. I felt this elation when I first heard “Breathe In” by Frou Frou, a track about the same world-stopping phenomenon but pertaining to love. “And I'm high enough from all the waiting/To ride a wave on your inhaling'' is the moment singer Imogen Heap reaches love-induced ecstasy, and she takes us along for the ride. The blissful bassline that opens the track is the sound of FOMO, something you’d hear when passing a party you wish you’d been invited to. The lilting, saccharine guitar pulled straight from The Cure on the chorus heralds the moment you walk into the party and everybody cheers because you’re actually awesome and you proceed to have the best night ever. And with that Imogen successfully lures us into fantasy musicland, but there’s a reason it all seems too good to be true. Everything drops out at the bridge when Heap repeats “Is this it?” building tension anxiously until she eventually admits “Yes.” The veil has dropped – take a look at the lyrics and it’s clear Imogen’s infatuation is ill-guided, and likewise the fun little dream that plays in one’s head when this song is heard will <expandableText text="never happen" hiddenText="unless you're incredibly popular at parties"></expandableText>.

    content: `With the lavish reissue of Pavement’s final album <em>Terror Twilight</em> finally released, there is no better time to revisit the project. In truth, it's always been a difficult album for me to connect with despite my all too common fanaticism for the group. Much like the final albums from Hüsker Dü or The Replacements, there is a felt difference between its content and the energy put into the recording. The newly matured songwriting doesn't mesh with a band holding back its loose and sophomoric charm, and the result feels more strung-out than suited-up.\nI do want to stress that this album has some amazing moments.The alternate track listing from producer Nigel Godrich highlights the number of true-blue pop songs on the album by cramming them all into the more immediately accessible b-side. This new order doesn’t do much to improve the albums reputation, and like many retrospectives the constant tinkering might dull the albums magic. However, the uncharacteristically straightforward presentation of these songs does a lot more to clue us in on the state of the band at this time and helps us pick apart this obtuse record more thoroughly.\nThe first track of the b-side “Billie” &nbsp;features a mix of DNA between early pavement and what would eventually color the more heartfelt moments of Steven Malkmus’ self-titled solo LP. Lyrically it marries the character study of “Jenny And The Ess-Dog” with the free association of “Serpentine Pad.” Anchored around a prominent acoustic guitar, the song starts off slow enough before transitioning into full jam rock. The track keeps you on your toes without the feeling of annoyance that can often accompany this sort of aesthetic, and is probably a good introduction for those Pavement neophytes out there. I wouldn’t go so far as to claim this is the best track on <em>Terror Twilight</em>, but it caught my attention this time around and certainly deserves more love. You can find more information on the<em> Farewell Horizontal</em> box set <a href="https://pavement.bandcamp.com/album/terror-twilight-farewell-horizontal"><u>here</u></a>.`,

    content: `On the first Bauhaus song in 14 years, Peter Murphy’s voice is as disembodied as a ghost, but he has no interest in returning to his old haunts. Sure, there’s a ​​<expandableText text="deep Reggae bassline" hiddenText="a nice reminder of post-punk's original roots, and an element many revivalists have discarded in favor of something more stilted and rocky
    "></expandableText> that would make Jah Wobble ~wobble~ with delight and a spindly guitar pulled straight from early contemporaries Siouxsie And The Banshees, but they’re only small actors in the track’s grander narrative. Each band member wrote their own parts to the song without hearing the others’ contributions – a patchwork approach that results in several surprise turns, like when a dense clap sends the track into a paranoid, acoustic lo-fi swamp that’d make a good home for Radiohead. Murphy’s menacing vocals of the past have morphed into something more frightened; his voice swirls untethered as he accepts his fate: “I’ll never see the boys again / Cause I’m off to the funny farm.” “Drink The New Wine” is an anti-anthem, an omen crafted by a band ready to step out of the shadows.`,

    content: `There is no artist as constantly in style as The Lemonheads. For as long as I have been listening to music it seems as if the songs on <em>It’s a Shame About Ray</em>, which recently turned 30,<em> </em>are in a constant state of rediscovery. The strength and timelessness of these songs seem to offhandedly mirror whatever you throw at them, and practically every guitar based pop movement in the last decade has made strides to claim them as a result. The second track off the album, “Confetti”, is today's song of the day purely because it’s the cut off the album most often stuck in my head. Featuring all vibes and little to no substance, this track manages to nail the summery power pop hooks the Lemonheads were so good at without any of the structural baggage some other cuts have. The video is interesting in that low effort - listless band playing to a background b-plot unrelated to the song - kind of 90’s thing.

While this breezy and textured pop anthem is most reminiscent of The Lemonheads and earlier MBV, it still integrates their midwestern identity. This is the kind of short and direct pop song Husker Dü was releasing later in their career. When taken as a whole, these singles suggest a new and refined direction for a group that was already putting most shoegaze bands to shame.

    content: `Wire’s first album <em>Pink Flag </em>is seminal because it takes a handful of simple tools – guitars made of sandpaper, rapid, ladder-like chants, cryptic lyrics – and smashes them together to form economic punk songs, with the mission to discover new ways to shape an anthem. Their follow-up <em>Chairs Missing </em>eclipses <em>Pink Flag </em>by toying with not only song structure, but <em>mood</em>. An obvious example is “I Feel Mysterious Today,” a lurking, drumless creeper of a track fit for dark alleys. "I Am The Fly" kicks the cosplay up a notch with a character study on the household's most infamous pest – shrill guitars flit around honey-trapped synth, while singer Colin Newman fully inhabits the insect’s role: “I am the fly in the ointment/I can spread more disease than the fleas.” “I Am The Fly” becomes an anthem in its own right despite the repulsive subject matter; the song is a precursor to the seriously taken piss-takes of 90’s ironic indie rock.`,

His upcoming album <em>Boat Songs</em> is shaping up to be quite an exciting release. Lenderman excels at painting vividly empathetic and humane characters with his off-kilter brand of Americana, and newest single “TLC Cagematch” does all that and more, handling the image of an aging professional wrestler with grace and confidence.

    createdAt: 1647626746,
    image: HERMAN_THUMBNAIL,
    content: `“John Henry” is a folk song gone wrong. The track is fashioned from the traditional Scots ballad “Lass of Roch Royal,” with original lyrics that tell the tall tale of the steel driver <a href="https://www.nps.gov/neri/planyourvisit/the-legend-of-john-henry-talcott-wv.htm"><u>John Henry</u></a> – an American legend who bested a steam drill in a competition at the price of his own life. “John Henry” starts menacingly enough, with a dark drone and an autoharp played nervously. But as singer Marion Coutts plows through the verses, the song’s sanity is chipped away at more and more with loopy percussion, chunks of sparking guitar, and a wiry fiddle desperate to keep grasp of the track’s folksy roots. Coutts finishes the tale with the death of Henry on the mountain, mimicked by the song’s rapid acceleration like the last furious heartbeats of the overworked steel driver, and then the inevitable slowdown and collapse. “John Henry” is able to deconstruct folk song structure while staying true to the oft-told legend behind the lyrics.`,

    content: `My Dad is Dead’s most recognized album <em>Let’s Skip the Details </em>is a notably dark and inhospitable work even within the realm of post punk. As the title suggests, one of the work's main preoccupations is the many ways in which communication can fail us, and how attempts at mutual understanding can further isolate. Album opener “Baby’s Got a Problem” is the greatest statement in this regard. By dancing around the true nature of our subject’s wounds, project frontman Mark Edwards dwells on the intangible ways that past trauma stays with us and affects our future relationships. Heavy stuff. The album is also notable for beefing up the group from a solo project to a full backing band, and the sound benefits greatly from it. <em>Let’s Skip the Details </em>dwells between the abrasive bile of Big Black and the more accessible jangle projects of R.E.M. and Camper Van Beethoven, and as a result, Mark Edwards makes damage sound pretty damn captivating.`,

    content: `Yeule is dejected throughout their second album <em>Glitch Princess</em>. Anxious thoughts manifest as tarnished hyperpop that, as a result of the paralyzing distortion and malfunctioning electronics that cut through the record, doesn’t feel so hyper. One method of escape from this haze is attempted on “Electric” – Nat Ćmiel rises above despondency with a high-pitched wail, but their voice is still coated in digital effects that mask their true self. The most bare song on <em>Glitch Princess</em> is the most affecting: “Don’t Be So Hard On Your Own Beauty” is built by honeyed acoustic strums and two strands of Ćmiel’s voice, more unadorned than anywhere else on the record. Here a friend joins Ćmiel in the dark, lighting a match to guide them back to their lost self-worth. The vocals are mostly one-note, they’re breathless, grueling strides towards something brighter, a journey impossible taken alone: “Fall again, you pick up all my guts/Spilling out, bruised up, bloodied up.” Much of <em>Glitch Princess </em>is spent searching for an oasis, somewhere to rest one’s head. On this track, Yeule finds it. <br></br> Support Yeule on <a href="https://yeule.bandcamp.com/album/glitch-princess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>Bandcamp</u></a>`,

Their sound is a unique blend of heavy rock and alternative-pedal-tomfoolery that is only becoming more influential as metal infused shoegaze becomes a bigger movement. For my money, bands like Nothing and DIIV take a lot more from this sound than the usual suspects, MBV and Slowdive. One of Catherine Wheel’s signature songs, “Crank” was almost the title track to their second and most popular album <em>Chrome</em>. One listen and you can hear why, this is easily the most accessible and instantly gratifying cut on the album. “Crank” takes the band's heavier fixations and drapes them over smoldering power pop to create true bliss; the leanness and utility of its composition is something to marvel at.`,

    content: `I would like to continue the thread of yesterday's unnoticed anthem by introducing a track that did find its audience. “Do You Remember The First Time?” remains one of Pulps signature tracks, the second single off of their breakthrough album <em>His ‘n’ Hers</em>. By the time of their success, Jarvis Cocker had been in Pulp for half of his life. A picture is painted of a botched first sexual experience, and the jealousies and desires – both realized and incomplete – that spring from that instance. By looking back on an era of youthful inexperience with world weariness and acidity, “Do You Remember The First Time?” ties off the band's first fifteen years with a ribbon. Regardless of how petulant the subject matter is, though, the track’s soaring and intimate chorus has an unmet verve that sends me into hysterics almost three decades later. Jarvis Cocker would deliver more refined anthems in later albums, but the scrappier package has an underdog appeal that, at least sentimentally, reaches the heights of later achievements.`,

    content: `As I was leafing through the wonderful <a href="https://www.sproutology.co.uk/"><u>Sproutology</u></a> site to conduct research for my upcoming Prefab Sprout article, I stumbled across a little band called Hurrah!. They were the first band to sign to Kitchenware, the label home to Prefab Sprout, and it’s clear the two bands were cut from similar cloths: the lead singer for Hurrah! (Paul Handyside) carries much of the same emotional affect in his voice as Prefab’s singer Paddy McAloon. But Hurrah! never quite saw the success of Prefab Sprout and their material is quite tough to find on online streaming. One song of theirs that I was able to discover is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOybuxbL104"><u>“Let It Be Her”</u></a> from 1989. The track’s built on pretty standard jangle-pop guitars, backed by chugging strums that conjure the same tone as overdone smolder on the album’s cover. But the pre-chorus uses the same bold, ringing chord as one of Prefab Sprout’s most overlooked tracks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVoJDXdDgLU"><u>“The Golden Calf,”</u></a> &nbsp;while chorus is a powerhouse in its own: Handyside wails “Please let it be her” like it’s a rollercoaster, launching the song to new anthemic heights. The anthem never found its audience, but there’s a certain appeal to discovering an obscure track that never quite filled the shoes it wanted to wear.`,

    content: `For my money, the best track on Big Thief’s splendid new album <em>Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You</em> is buried halfway through. “Flower of Blood” is a slow burning epic showcasing the outfits more adventurous side, sonically reminiscent of 80’s alt-rock and the last decade of bedroom pop while remaining fresh. The rather straightforward understated lyrics “Hearing you sigh soft and heavy/ Holding mine 'til you feel ready” give the track time to breathe and work as a complement to the rather driven instrumentation. This is a song showcasing Big Thief as a cohesive rock outfit rather than the more folk inspired Lenker vehicles that can be found across <em>DNWMIBIY</em>, and I am sure will sound great in a festival environment. “Flower of Blood '' is a <em>vibe </em>not a statement, this is a track you want companioning late night drives and special moments. For a band often taken too seriously in its weighty concepts this is a nice change of pace.<br></br>We have also published a mini review of Big Thief’s new album <em>Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You</em> that can be found <a href="https://www.plasticstyle.net/reviews/big-thief-dragon-new-warm-mountain-i-believe-in-you"><u>here</u></a>.`,

    content: `Texture, time, and the art of surprise. Alpha Maid, aka Leisha Thomas, uses all of these tools in spades on her 2021 EP <em>CHUCKLE</em>. Guitars chime like bells that choke mid-ring; trumpets dissolve into sirens. “Hungry, healthy, no time to eat,” she cries, fueling confusion into the quickly shifting flickers that pose as songs. Melodies give way to madness, and it's never quite clear where Thomas is headed. "Doggy" jitters with a broken riff, an obscured stutter that ends the EP on an uneasy question. Listen enough times, though, and each unexpected turn becomes natural, a strange comfort of kinship with the unknown.<br></br>Support Alpha Maid on <a href="https://canvas-index.bandcamp.com/album/chuckle"><u>Bandcamp</u></a>`,

    content: `Faust-adjacent art pop group Slapp Happy exist in the liminal space between disdain and studied adherence for the pop format. While some of their tracks feel unenthusiastically put together, they never lack craft. Dagmar Krause’s vocals in particular elevate the group’s pretensions into something remarkable. “Dawn” is a personal highlight off of their most recognizable album,<em> Casablanca Moon. </em>The cinematic quality of the arrangement is striking: the horns at the forefront provide this dust-caked western drive, while the nimble guitar roaming in the background provides the surface level sheen of a Bond film. Lyrically we are dropped right in the middle of action, an unspecified chase involving a rather urbane cowboy. While each member had other musical ambitions, they sure did make some wonderful pop songs.`,

It is a case of staggering musicality that this art rock outfit can casually drop a classic in a different genre while retaining their identity.`,

The song’s got instant swagger; its jagged beat sways recklessly on the breathtaking precipice teens find themselves when harboring an unrequited crush – a volatile ‘I don’t need you anyway’ kinda attitude. 18-year old Zeke’s heartbroken adrenaline soon gets the best of them, though, and they careen into one hell of an emotional fallout. The explosion starts with an angsty, distortingly warbling bassdrop; a few seconds of tender, crying in the pillow pianos the eye of the hurricane before it’s all blown to a fuck, my universe is imploding, M83-sized grandness of crashing cymbals and spacefaring synths. Finally we land back in a tear-ridden bed and Zeke’s still plucking away at a despondent bass riff but now with some kind of resolve: “I don't really wanna be someone that gets in your way/But I won't let it slide past my face, what you said yesterday.” The track’s restlessness is bound to cause whiplash, but that’s kind of the point. “Movies For Guys” and <a href="https://dltzk.bandcamp.com/album/frailty-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u><em>Frailty</em></u></a><em></em> as a whole use a heapload of varied electronic textures, rapid tone switches, and a knack for heart on the sleeve cinematics to map out the minutiae of adolescent emotion with remarkable accuracy.`,

    content: `Welcome to the very first interview for plasticstyle.net! I got to sit down with Angel Marcloid of Fire-Toolz to talk about her recent LP <em>Eternal Home</em>, which was one of my favorite albums of last year. It was featured on my year-end list, which you can read here. Also, if you’re a podcast kinda person the interview is on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3thkz7YyXEveLiyLu8MuYe"><u>Spotify</u></a> and <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/plasticstyledotnet/fire-toolz-interview/"><u>Mixcloud</u></a>! OR if you want to watch the full, uncut interview check it out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWTFYfNMmY"><u>YouTube</u></a>!\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>Welcome to the show Angel! Really excited to have you here – when Eternal Home came out it really blew me away. You have had quite a few solo projects but now it seels Fire Toolz have become one of your main focuses. What was the genesis of the fire toolz moniker -- what were your goals for the project, and how did you come up with the name itself?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> It’s hard to find a starting point, because really the starting point is like the big bang and &nbsp;everything just kind of comes after the thing before. I have been playing music forever. I guess I can say that when I started using computers to help me make electronic music is probably when fire toolz started to come more into focus. Because I was playing in bands with guitar, drums, etc. for a long time and then I got really into noise music in the late 2000’s. I was already playing acoustic solo music at the time but the noise stuff really inspired me and made me feel a lot more creative when it came to making solo music. So I was doing a lot more of that with hands on stuff and pedals and electronics of various kinds.The possibilities were truly endless when it came to computers. I was doing a combination of chillwave and trance and ambient music and stuff akin to 80’s pop. But then I was listening to more noise with vocals attached to it. Abstract vocals stuff like Wolf Eyes and Russian Tsarlag which was very folky but avant garde with weird vocals. I started making stuff like that using computers and just put improvised vocals over it. I was using a different moniker but changed the name to Fire-Toolz on the following album and the music started becoming a bit more structured and less nihilistic. That has taken me to where I am today.\n\nI love the instant gratification of making music on a computer. It really beats writing a song on a guitar and rehearsing it and practicing for months before maybe playing a show. I can sit in my room for months all day long and not even have them written. The name Fire-Toolz came from an early internet terrorism tool, like mailbombing and pinging IP addresses to slow their connections and fishing tools that would constantly try new passwords until it guessed them – really bad stuff. I didn’t use them much but I was constantly fascinated by those kinds of tools that these young anarchistic programmers would make and release. I remember Fire Tools was for AOL but I added the ‘z’ and ‘-’. Unfortunately the creator struggled with a whole lot of trauma and mental illness and passed away a long time ago. When I started looking into it I felt kind of exploitative and wasn’t sure I still wanted to use this name. You know like the way people are with serial killers where they do terrible things and get propped up as icons? I didn’t want to do that here but I love the 90’s aesthetic, the whole cyberpunk thing; that's why I use it. I think its silly and the music doesn't quite fit as much but I have grown attached to it and love it.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>Yeah I personally love the name. When I hear the name Fire-Toolz it reminds me of the tools you would use to make a fire and I think your music has all these different elements that come together to make something pretty explosive and fiery.</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> There is a company called fire tools in Germany and I am surprised they have never bothered me about the name. When you go on twitter and don't use the underscore you will go to their Twitter. I am sure they know about me because the only three things on the internet with that name at this point are me, the hacking program and that company. I thought it would be cool to have a collaboration, like a fire poker with my logo on it. I might ask them about that someday.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>So one of my favorite things about the Fire-Toolz aesthetic is that most of the vocals are screaming, regardless of the other sounds surrounding you. Was there a moment where you decided that would be the main aesthetic or was that more natural?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> I don't really know why I started doing that – I am a singer. I have sung in a lot of bands, some with harsh vocals. I think it was that I really liked the idea of combining screaming with music you might not hear it over. I really like early emo and screamo. What I really love about those bands is that there will be extremely mellow bits with intense screaming on top of that. Even though my music is more aggressive I just really love that pairing. I am singing a bit more now and I just recorded a track the other day that was only singing. I am starting to branch out a bit more now. But it was just what I needed and wanted to do at the time. I really love bands like Skinny Puppy and bile and the remixed old fear factory tunes that are out there. So I really love screaming with electronic music . It’s also easy, I don’t need to come up with melodies, it's just kind of like static noise that I can put over anything and it’s easy to mix. So there are a lot of reasons. I am sure I am going to keep doing it, though I will start singing a lot more as well.\n\n<b>Parker:</b><em> That is one of the coolest parts of the project. On “Yearning = Alchemical Fire” you’re screaming in that but it’s a danceable beat. I could imagine it being on in a club. I think in this project which sound more direct with a straightforward song structure. Was that intentional when putting together this album?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> No. I just kind of start with a sound and the songs start to write themselves. So some of them come out a little more pop oriented and some of them come out quite the opposite. I mean I like pop structures, the verse chorus verse chorus kind of thing, I grew up on that. But there's never a moment when I think “I should write a pop song.” I just start messing around with a synth or a noise and it just happens.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>I do think there's a really cool balance between songs that have a more coherent structure versus others that are more amorphous, or songs like “--&gt; ¶rogressive --&gt; ¶ath --&gt;", which are more just like a sound collage. What do you think would be missing if you mashed together an EP of the most straightforward songs?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> Well I've never wanted to do that. I have had that idea proposed to me. When I was talking to my label I was given the idea that I should have some genre oriented EP’s, the metal oriented one the jazz one, etc.. But that's not who I am. That doesn’t reflect anything in my life at all. My life is full of, and seems to require, all these elements fusing together. I am not interested in focusing right now, I am in this mode of anything goes. It's not random, it's not like it's not intentional. The idea might be spontaneous. I might be working on a song and it has a beat and a chorus, and I just decide that I should add a wall of noise here. That's just how it happens. I don't have any interest in organizing things too much. I have this EP <em>I Can't Die</em>, and it has a straight up rock song, like how I wish Rush sounded these days. But I was like OK, I need some balance here. So track two is this weird drone noise thing. I like throwing people off like that. I like to disrupt their experience. You thought you were listening to a prog rock record, well, now you have to listen to 6 minutes of something where you dont know what's going on – you don't know when it's going to kick in and it never does. It’s anarchy in a way. It is just what I do. I might get sick of it one day. I thought I would have by now, but I haven't.\n\n<b>Parker:</b><em> You’ve talked about how Fire-Toolz being a reflection of yourself, even like a diary. Do you think including these more confusing sections reflects your mental space?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> Absolutely. Life is not a genre. In the course of one day we can go from grief and suicide ideation to pure joy. We can have days where everything goes right or days where everything seems to go wrong. There are unexpected turns constantly. Because Fire-Toolz is a documentation of my spiritual development and psychological evolution it wouldn't make sense to try and make a certain kind of music. Right now I want to become more in touch with who I am and I want to become more integrated into the world in ways that make me feel safe and ways I can help people and help myself. If I want to reflect that in my music, it would be just stupid to stick to one sound.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>The first line on the album - “These rocks absolutely must become jewels by first light tomorrow” feels like this anxiety about getting things completed or working on mental health. You must be really busy completing your music and working with </em><a href="https://www.angelhairaudio.com/"><u><em>Angel Hair Studios</em></u></a><em>. What does that line signify to you?</em>\n\n<b>Angel: </b>Well, you’re very close. I don’t know, you’re kind of spot on, but it’s not really a statement about getting things done in life. I don't really have a problem with that. I’ve always had a drive and been able to work really hard. It is more like my own refinement and development as a person, working through my trauma and working past things that I get stuck on psychologically. It is sort of this insistence and I guess healing and getting past things. I am really impatient a lot of times because sometimes when I've been working for so long and I still have these troubles and I’m just like - “come on!”. &nbsp;The song <a href="https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/track/where-on-earth-is-my-sacchid-nanda"><u>“Where On EARTH Is My Sacchidānanda?”</u></a> &nbsp;is basically elaborating on that. All the lyrics are kind of this whiny sort of entitled perspective where I am just like - I have done all this work where is my peace where is my healing? I have worked so hard! I demand it now. I am not going to work any longer.\n\nBut yeah that line reflects an experience in my childhood where I got this thing called a <expandableText text="rock tumbler" hiddenText="I too got a rock tumbler and had a very similar experience to Angel"></expandableText>. I got really excited because the front of the box has these shiny looking jems and I wanted to make them. I set it up and was reading the box and found out it would take weeks. The idea of waiting for that long, it caused me this inner pain. I didn’t want to deal with all this time passing. It seemed very hard. My dad told me this story about when he was in the Navy and was writing my mom letters and they would take weeks to get to her. He would be expressing where he was in the moment but by the time they would get to her he would be in a completely different place. He told me that at the time to sort of console and help me and just say “Look this is how life is, you kind of need to be patient to get the best result.”\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>As the album reaches its second half it becomes a bit more nebulous. There are these bursts of energy around these more amorphous sections. This got me wondering about how you put together the tracklisting, were you trying to take the listeners on a particular journey?</em>\n\n<b>Angel: </b>Like a lot of things in my music it feels like they happen by themselves or they put themselves together. I guess you could say I feel like a robot or a computer program that is set up by a higher entity. So really with the track order I was just trying to think of a cool order. I kept scooting songs around to find what feels good. One thing that was really intentional was putting the song “Thick_flowy_glowy_sparkly_stingy_pain.mpeg” right next to &nbsp;“Where On EARTH Is My Sacchidānanda?” because I thought it would be really cool to have this section where it is just drums, bass, guitar and making the industrial and glitchy elements take a backseat for a bit.\nSo the peaks and valleys are sort of intentional. But believe it or not I didn't just sit there and plan it out. I also had it in mind that this was going on vinyl. I had to make sure these 4 sections are gonna fit on a side of vinyl, so that did play a role. I am not good at concept albums because I am not good at planning something and following through exactly what I planned. I actually hate doing that, it’s very limiting. I want to let life blow my sailboat around.\n\n<b>Parker: </b><em>So I do like a lot of the song titles, and one of them in particular sounded like a video game title - “Awakening Fantasy™ 2.” I was wondering if you played any video games ofr if that influenced any of Eternal Home.</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> I love videogames but I never play them. I don't really enjoy playing them but I do like watching friends play them. I mostly hate violent video games, but if it's really fantasy or sci-fi I can deal with a little violence. I enjoy Super Mario World and that shit’s violent. I did play Super Mario and Metroid as a kid. Video game music definitely inspires me. I have an SNES and an NES and I want to try and get the games I got as a kid. I am just not into them the way some of my friends are. The word ‘awakening’ in the title is referring to a spiritual awakening of sorts, a psychological breakthrough. The ™ refers to the commercialization of spiritual learning and teachers. I don't really have a problem with that sort of thing because I have bought many of those courses. I love spiritual teachers. But the lyrics are about my idolizing and romanticizing the process of spiritual awakening instead of a more authentic experience. The word fantasy refers to me fantasizing about those breakthroughs. The ‘2’ is there because I have used the title in an earlier project and wanted to use it again.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> So in two different songs these two characters pop up - the scientist and the mystic - on "Umbilical Cord Blood" you talk about them having an “awkward dinner date.” What do they represent to you?\n\n<b>Angel:</b> It's a huge theme in my psychological exploration. They refer to an inner child and an inner adult. I am a scientist mystic – you would think these things would be two opposites and they kind of are. My life's journey is integrating them. There are some huge mystics who ignore practicality and logic, and those who are so about logic and science that are black or white thinkers who deny the existence of whatever they can't measure. I very strongly have both of these things always on fire within me- I think they fit together perfectly like yin and yang – but being conditioned by our culture, there’s so much of a war in between them. I’m learning new ways to get them to work together. And if you think about it like inner child and inner adult, the inner adult is the scientist – telling my inner child to stop crying, to get into line – and my inner child needs support and love.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>So I do think there is a kind of virtuosity to this music, some really cool, unique chords. I know you’ve collabed with Adam Neely, who’s all about the music theory. Do you think a lot about theory when writing songs or is it more about what sounds cool?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> Well this is a good example of a scientist mystic type thing. I do love theory, and I love Adam Neely so much, he’s such a sweetheart. I love his YouTube channel, and I wish I knew a fraction of what he knows about theory. But the mystic metaphor comes in because I am just doing what sounds good, weird, or interesting. I would say a portion of my music has theory in mind, I intentionally want to use certain chords that bring up certain feelings in me. I really take a lot of tips from jazz fusion and second wave emo because they put a lot of focus on dissonance. But I’m not like ‘I need to sit down and write something in harmonic minor.’ So I would say it’s mostly based on feeling but knowing some theory is really helpful because I use it to evoke the feeling I’m going for.\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>Last question: So obviously the album deals a lot about the concept of home, considering the title itself is Eternal Home. What does the concept of home mean to you, in general?</em>\n\n<b>Angel:</b> Well there’s a lot of different ways you can interpret the word home and they’re all part of the title. If we’re just talking about where we live physically, that type of home has always been so important to me. It’s my home base, it’s where I feel safe and the most inspired. As you can see by my surroundings, it’s like I puked my inner self all over my walls. I have cat posters, brightly colored tapestries everywhere. And for awhile I was really struggling feeling at home and settled because I knew that most of these places I was living were not permanent. I find a lot of comfort in the idea of permanence but there’s no such thing as permanent. So I’ve had to really do a lot of work to settle in and relax in a temporary space. So the reason why the last part of the album is titled ‘home for now’ is because I was talking to a friend of mine who said my space is ‘my home for now.’ That really just struck me because I realized I can relax completely into this space because it is my home <em>for now</em>, and when that changes I can worry about it then. It seems really simple but there was a shift within me when that was able to click.\n\nBut zooming out to the eternal part, home is really just your existence – that’s where you’re seated, there’s no such thing as not being home. &nbsp;Anytime you feel like you’re not home, it’s an illusion - if you can just get in touch with your inner home, there’s a real sense of comfort and relaxation that can come about. I could go into a bunch of different theologies from spiritual traditions to explain this, but I won’t do that. The idea of home is a very spiritual thing as much as a physical thing for me. I struggled a lot coming up with a title, but one day I was just like “ah that’s it.”\n\n<b>Parker:</b> <em>Any projects on the horizon you want to shout out?</em>\n\n<b>Angel: </b>I have a series on YouTube called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5cRRlxdns4&amp;t=37s"><u>“Behind The Muzak,”</u></a> where I answer fans’ questions about my work. I just released an <em>Eternal Home </em>Behind the Muzak episode – I asked people on my Instagram stories to ask me questions about <em>ET </em>&nbsp;and I filmed myself answering all the questions. I also just finished working on a video for “Odd Cat Sanctuary.” I would really love it if people <expandableText text="subscribed" hiddenText="Her videos are top notch! highly recommend"></expandableText> to my YouTube channel, because I have this weird desire to do the Youtuber thing. I also post stuff on Instagram and have a mailing list.`,

    content: `This is a serious problem I’m not joking. Every time I pull out my laptop and try to write (which is definitely every day because I definitely am a very productive individual) I inevitably hear the trademark electronic gurgles that set up Smashing Pumpkins’ second best song “1979.” &nbsp;I may not know how my finger landed on the play button but I certainly can’t prevent it once it starts -- the slicked-down mid-90’s indie rock strums are so very irresistible. I blame Ben for issuing an ultimatum at the record store I work at: he would either leave or I would play Corgin’s spiritual successor to Sonic Youth’s “Teenage Riot.” It’d been bouncin’ around the ol’ brain for the past few days as a result of its baffling inclusion on <expandableText text="my work's" hiddenText="Not the record store but the BBQ joint I work at - it's New York I have three jobs"></expandableText> “60’s And 70’s Popular Rock” playlist, so I had no problem relenting to Ben’s demand.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe Pumpkins’ ode to fading youth soundtracked my life nonstop for the following week, but that was only the beginning. Before long my addiction extended to all of the tracks on <em>Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> — I played "Tonight, Tonight" about twenty times to dramatize my trips to the laundromat, and I couldn’t stop binging the record’s unimpeachable row of ballads that populate the second half. How am I supposed to write when I could instead succumb to the sweet drawl of “Lily My One and Only” or get swept up in the psychedelic tide of “Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans?”\n\nI let myself get captured by the siren songs of <em>Melon Collie</em> because I like to follow the implicit advice of “1979” and enjoy the rush while it lasts. When you come across an album you just can't peel your ears away from, lean into it. Because after all, one day we'll all turn to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aeETEoNfOg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dust</a> I guess.`,
