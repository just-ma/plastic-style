        content: `Yup, slowcore is another thing that can be traced back to The Velvet Underground. “Candy Says” is gentle and delicate and definitely influenced The For Carnation’s careful, hushed dynamics approach, while Lou Reed’s languid vocals set the blueprint for Acetone. Lou’s words on the song’s meaning also encapsulate the vibe of slowcore (and emo) pretty well: “We look in the mirror and we don't like what we see...I don't know a person alive who doesn't feel that way."`,

You can point to a dozen or so Young tracks that are slow, heavy, and rife with riffage, but “Cortez” is less of the “throw back a beer” vibe that most of these songs evoke, and more of “hold back your tears.”`,

It’s a testament to Big Thief’s dynamic control and storytelling prowess, and it’s also a testament to slowcore’s ability to balance tension on the edge of a knife.`,

It makes sense, because an integral part of slowcore’s definition insists that the music contains some form of <em>rock</em>. Vince Staples is not rock. But hear me out. Listen to the sample used on “Summertime.” It's a broken shard of dark guitar, apocalyptically sad when paired with Vince’s cold despair.`,

Halfway through vocals appear, lyrics speak to searching for a land beyond lands. And that’s how I feel when I listen, getting lost in a place where there’s nowhere to go.`,

        content: `I could write yet another article about all the styles explored on The Smashing Pumpkins’ underrated album <em>Adore</em>, but I won’t, instead I’ll just keep threatening to. “Shame” is classic head-hung-low slowcore, with Corgan pulling a typical Pumpkins move by simultaneously praising and condemning love: “Love is good and love is kind / Love is drunk and love is blind.” I like how punchy and subtly electronic the drums are – put next to the startlingly human moaning of the guitar, it brings a similar contrast as the lyrics.`,

        content: `“The Tourist” is the type of slowcore song that makes me want to slouch and breathe out a long sigh of relief. Maybe it’s because this song arrives at the end of an album-long trip through anxiety and paranoia, but even when divorced from the rest of <em>Ok Computer</em>, “The Tourist” provides quite the release. I’m hesitant to label any Radiohead song as the best of anything for fear of being basic and boring, but I have to admit that “The Tourist” is my favorite slowcore song.`,

        content: `“Secret Lovers At The Heaven’s Gate Ranch” packs a lot into a one-minute-and-thirty-seconds song, and it’s a great example of a slowcore emo crossover. It’s definitely the darkest zone of slowcore, and this track is especially bleak, serving as a slowed last heartbeat to an otherwise manic album. “This drink could be the last for you and me / Don't swallow.”`,

        artist: 'Sophia Chablau e Uma Enorme Perda de Tempo',
        content: `Despite their irreverent name, which translates to “Sophia Chablau and an enormous waste of time,” the group’s debut is anything but banal. This 23-minute self-titled LP gets right to the point on raucous opener <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpkJQYIOSkI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>“Pop Cabecinha”</u></a>, initiated by a screeching guitar chord and one precise vibraslap. The band’s jittery hits and slack chemistry quickly give way to the wistful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu9CYLFXUCQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>“Se Você”</u></a>, on which Chablau’s haunting vocal performance is supported solely by murky bass until a droning cacophony creeps in on the back half. This vast dynamic range is one of the record’s signatures, swinging wildly from melancholic reflection to free-wheeling bombast and back again. Chablau adjusts her tone accordingly, whether musing over intimacy and isolation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTL0tkcyLyY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>“Fora do Meu Quarto”</u></a> or lampooning American imperialism on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsin4fNBZs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>“Hello”</u></a>, the lyrics of which gradually subsume English with Portuguese (“a very pretty lingua!”). The band heaps humor and personality atop luscious vintage production helmed by Ana Frango Elétrico, who hails from the same São Paulo scene. The sonic character she contributes is crucial; the record’s only preceding single, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ezj_7WGUrY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>“Delicia/Luxúria”</u></a>, leads with a menacing drum break so blown-out it can be difficult to hear the notes. The same break closes the track, its oversaturated snare roll careening into nothingness – an abrupt ending which leaves not a moment wasted.<br></br>Support Sophia Chablau directly via <a href="https://sophiachablaueumaenormeperdade.bandcamp.com/album/sophia-chablau-e-uma-enorme-perda-de-tempo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>Bandcamp.</u></a>`,

        artist: 'Vince Staples',
        content: `This record is so quiet you’d think the mastering engineer turned the wrong knob. Lacking the Clams Casino whip-snares of <em>Summertime ‘06 </em>or glistening hyper-pop edge of <em>Big Fish Theory</em>, Vince Staples’ self-titled is the most understated in his discography. It’s also his most thoughtful; the tracks are similar enough to cohere (a welcome respite from the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3SpBlxme9WbeQdI9kx7KAV?si=YvLLWlg2TLmBV3z7WzsAcg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>double-LP “playlists”</u></a> that have caught on with A-list rappers) but nuanced enough that each element stands out. Much like the record’s cover – an extreme close up on Vince’s face – the music asks the listener to hone in on small details, like garbled piano interpolations tucked into corners of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTri3zbX-R8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>“Law of Averages”</u></a> or a counter melody hidden in the sub bass on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DMIqqeDZgAXA&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1641802760572671&amp;usg=AOvVaw2T2B_TyI83nFvUdGdWc9k7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>“Lil Fade”</u></a>. Where the low end would normally propel the instrumentals, Kenny Beats’ 808s give atmosphere without crowding the stage. Front and center is Vince, whose evocations of life in Long Beach are tinged with his trademark colloquial complexity: “Yeah I love you ‘cause you black/ But don’t love your ass like that/ I will put you on a shirt/ If you fuck me out my racks”. His delivery, at once apathetic and deeply remorseful, remains constant throughout <em>Vince Staples</em>, matching the reservedness of the production for a compellingly consistent listen.`,

The characters mingle with one another and recur, managing to endow a truncated record with the air of an anthology. These narratives are buoyed by opaque emotions, inexplicably made more candid by their lack of clarity. The intimacy Sutkowski achieves is even more impressive considering the scarcity of instrumentation; many of the tracks are solely acoustic guitar and vocals, mic’d closely enough to pick up little plucks and scratches which lend an inviting coarseness.

Opener <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aHdWwGhSTw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>“Just Wrong”</u></a> woos you with snare brush fizz and thick brass layers which crescendo then deconstruct over a fucked up backbeat.

His playfulness gives <em>Notes with Attachments </em>much of its color, but Pino’s bass lines are the foundation; they surface as needed from beneath the vast array of instrumentation, propelling the harmony and rhythm of each track. Palladino and Mills’ chemistry coalesces most impressively on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fd9U-MT1z4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>“Ekuté”</u></a> – the pair takes what could’ve easily been a passable one-chord afrobeat jam and loads it with surprises. Each time you think the form has stagnated, another rabbit is pulled from the top hat: the groove halts before an atemporal harp-ish strumming, drums pouring in formlessly, the bass re-centering to take us out with textured thumb-plucks. Normally you only get this degree of musical experience from a record’s personnel in jazz or classical, genres plagued by lethargy and self-seriousness. <em>Notes with Attachments </em>is unique not for the quality of the performances (which is undoubtedly quite high) but for its commitment to relaying those performances in a way that sounds modern.`,

But as extravagant as the “bike track and zipline at the other <em>other </em>crib” may be, what really cinches <em>Call Me’s </em>success is Tyler’s aptitude as executive producer; he navigates seamlessly from 2008 strip club trap to new jack swing to Lil’ Wayne free associating over Henry Mancini.

The vocals rasp and peak noisily – I picture him recording all eight and a half minutes in one take onto a cheap mic, and the braggadocio rings hollow in comparison. With the whole of <em>Call Me </em>in frame Tyler’s lavish expenditure seems little more than an expensive coping mechanism for a very relatable story about love and regret.`,

On their 13th LP <em>HEY WHAT</em>, the married duo of Mimi Parker and Alan Sparhawk focus on identifying and exploiting a songs’ breaking point.<em> </em>The first single and album centerpiece “Days Like These'' lays a foundation of yearning melody in classic Low fashion before a blast of mangled effects fuse to the duo’s voices like a defibrillator pressed to open flesh.\nLow delight in their newfound ability to shape sound like clay, routinely breaking the fourth wall to show just how easily a track can crumble. Opener “White Horses” feeds tightly-reined aggression into synths resembling impossibly brittle cellos, which eventually condense into bright metronomic stabs that are sanded down until they match the soft pulse of following track “I Can Wait.” The slow burner “All Night” could fill a stadium with its grand melodic sweeps, but as momentum picks up, rumbling distortion crushes Parker’s “La la la”s and swallows the song whole.\nThe penultimate track on the album, “More” is a blistering reminder that, even when <em>HEY WHAT </em>sounds out of control, Parker and Sparhawk (along with producer BJ Burton) are always the architects. Built with thick walls of guitar bristling with energy, “More” is an unadulterated banger, Parker’s effects-free voice delivering her lines chin up and eyes narrowed: “I learned more than what they ever taught / They thought I could never pull it off.” To ascend Low had to dismantle, then rebuild, then tear down and rebuild all over again.`,

They’re a stripped back post-punk outfit from the UK with an especially wry vocalist; the low-key name proves to be the best descriptor of their music. They’re sparse, sharp, and witty. Listen to album opener “Scratchcard Lanyard” and you’ll see what I mean. Dutiful drums and plodding bass set the stage for the instantly charming vocals of Florence Shaw, who cherrypicks her lyrics from disparate sources ranging from advertisements to YouTube comments, delivered deadpan with a glazed-over sardonic smile. “Do everything and feel nothing,” she mutters, before she’s showered by squalls of swirling guitar. Shaw somehow manages to make her Frankenstein lines seem at once nonsensical and astute: “Never talk about your ex/never, never, never, never slag them off” she advises on “Leafy,” then frets over whether to clean the uneaten sausages out of her fridge.

But, like any resourceful protagonist, he turns these flaws into strengths. It’s immediately noticeable that this LP was produced in a bedroom – the subdued vocals are as thin as a Macbook, the raucous drums possess a distorted crunch – but it aptly conveys the claustrophobic loneliness of a self-proclaimed outcast. Cloud-gazing synths flit nervously around these low-fi confinements, desperate for an escape from such despondency. Much of the album’s best moments resemble the bitter feeling of waking up from a perfect dream just to realize it’s not reality: the climactic nostalgia of Parrannoul’s “La La La”s on “Analog Sentimentalism,” the heart-wrenching screams that announce an alarm clock at the end of “White Ceiling.” The cathartic fuzz of <em>To See The Next Part Of The Dream </em>has spawned a burgeoning fanbase since its release, and yet Parrannoul has remained anonymous, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL7PSlUuWPs"><u>the hero we need</u></a>, not that we deserve.`,

One might assume this marks a shift away from <em>Compro</em>’s frigid soundscapes towards brighter pastures, but it more aptly relates to the teeming world of ideas Skee Mask has placed in <em>Pool</em>. The nearly two hour runtime<em> </em>gives Skee Mask room to toy with textures and rhythms to his heart’s content, resulting in a satisfying deep dive into his established ambient-meets-breakbeats sound.\nThe best moment of <em>Pool </em>arrives halfway with a trio of tracks (“Ozone,” “Rio Dub,” and “Tetsuo BC Mashup”) that move through tranquility, desolation, and new life in smooth fashion. “Ozone” is a welcome return to Skee Mask’s gauzy, romantic style of ambience: melodies shuffle through beats that flutter like snow, a hark back to the frost-covered landscape of <em>Compro</em>. “Rio Dub” imagines the aftermath of a long freeze where pools of drifting bass and decaying drums are the only remnants of a lush melody long lost. Cool drones breathe down spiky breakneck beats on “Tetsuo BC Mashup,” as if billions of sea urchins are being blown through a vast wind tunnel. Cohesive stretches of songs like these three make <em>Pool </em>more palatable, which is good because the whole thing is worth digesting.`,

Both artists draw small melodic circles in hushed tones, crafting songs that could pass for lullabies if they weren’t so sad. But unlike Grouper, Midwife’s tunes don’t belong in the intimate safe haven of the bedroom. Instead <em>Luminol </em>makes you feel lost with its thickly smeared guitar spread like dark clouds over empty plains. Home itself becomes hostile on “Enemy” as Johnston’s own body takes the form of an army out for blood, yet the measured repetition and near-monotone delivery of the lines “My body is against me / My body’s out to get me” sounds like an eerie anthem. This perplexing, chant-like nature haunts the album’s despair-filled phrases (“Love will break your heart forever”), and only makes sense when one observes the billowing columns of hazy guitar that encircle Johnston’s voice and build the songs into grand towers à la <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB7E1D_3Na4"><u>Spiritualized</u></a>.

There are kernels of mystique hidden throughout the album that color daily commutes and make them feel wondrous – with its smoky trumpets “Western Necropolis Twilight” could easily soundtrack a noir scene at dusk, while the arching guitar arpeggios on “Sun Caught Cloud Like The Belly Of A Cat” drop a trail of breadcrumbs that leads to an ebullient meadow of chirping birds and lilting slide guitar.

On "Earther" stuttering cello tiptoes forward, stretching its plucky fingers to pull off the creature’s hood but blown back by washes of synth. The chase is playful; trumpets waft through “Mir-Cam Startup” as a welcome distraction, “Until Mirror” unearths a lustrous choral chamber. Each careening push forward by the cello is met with tiny climaxes like shards of insight that if only pieced together could arrive at something revelatory. The album ends still searching, a mystery unsolved. We might never find out if it’s an alien, astronaut, or lost soul that inhabits Rankin’s lovely cover, but to know would ruin the spellbinding soundscape of <em>Mirror Guide.</em>`,

Ballooning synths and gently waving horns march forward, heralding a Zauner who flutters, and, for once, lets herself enjoy the parade. “How's it feel to be at the center of magic / To linger in tones and words?” It’s a self-facing query aimed at a chance for reprieve, a chance to reap the rewards of her music making, but Zauner has weathered too many storms to believe the sun will stay out. On “Slide Tackle,” she offers a way to tango with unwanted thoughts, threading a needle through her mind’s dark spots with nimble guitar licks and velvet-smooth bass that interlock and swirl. “Posing In Bondage'' finds comfort in the limits of partnership, a benign siren song that longs for an all-enveloping intimacy. The satisfying finale, “Posing For Cars” doubles down on Zauner’s eager heart with a three minute guitar solo that shoots sparks, mining deep for feelings of love words can’t express. At the height of her powers, Zauner sees everything: love, loss, greed, and also joy. On <em>Jubilee</em>, she chooses joy, and boy has she earned it.`,

Sometimes Angel indulges in direct impulses like on the gleeful shuffle of “Yearning = Alchemical Fire,” an exhilarating mashup of chugging EDM, cascading fusion guitar, and Marcloid’s signature scream. Other times, Angel doesn’t give a shit about being nimble and hurls you into deep throes of sonic limbo: “(e)y(e)s w/o a %brain%” feels like floating through space debris while undergoing a disassembly of mind and body, while “--&gt; ¶rogressive --&gt; ¶ath →” is a straight up wormhole of a sound collage.\nIt’s all part of the same great tapestry, sewn together by Angel’s lyrics that mine deep into existential ruminations while staying grounded enough to still be relatable.

On his latest solo effort <em>Forfolks </em>Parker moves forward by pulling back, stripping his songs down to just a guitar and the occasional breezy synth. Improvising over his own looped parts, he sounds equally ruminative and relaxed; his fingers follow the languid path of a daydream. The curious but cyclical “Four Folks” is infused with a sense of small stakes adventure, like if the wanderlust of Fripp and Eno’s majestically sweeping <em>Evening Star </em>was confined to the smooth-tiled floor of a hotel lobby.

In fact their preoccupation with showcasing their newfound chops would be a problem if they weren’t so<em> fucking satisfying.</em> “Life's Lemons'' and “White Rags'' are standout tracks that would have lacked breathing space on their previous album of tight knit punk songs. Not to say there are no great punk songs: “Someone’s Gunna Die'' remains my personal favorite – a straightforward and comfortable 70’s punk banger made modern by deft vocal harmonies and a triumphal harmonica. While it may at times feel like a cross-genre experiment, its sights are firmly set on being an incredibly solid rock album.`,

For how downright <em>bright </em>this album sounds, it hides some of John Ross’s more bitter and distant lyrics to date: “Everybody laughs easily/ There's something wrong with me”. The wonder of this record comes from the tension of pairing larger than life bombast with slight, almost fleeting, everyday emotion. Listening to domestic activities like watching<em> Temple of Doom</em> and seeking shelter from the rain be treated with the same gravity as a street race on Springsteen’s<em> Born to Run </em>proves to be incredibly life affirming.`,

        content: `I did not expect my standout record of the year to come from post-rock stalwarts Godspeed You! Black Emperor. This album has recaptured the vitality of their early releases, a return to form both eerily prognostic and lamentful when considering just how long the Montreal Collective have been foretelling the end of times. The album is full of all that has made their two decade old formula so fruitful - grandiose and spare instrumentation, layers of static and fuzz, and peaks and valleys to tug at one's heartstrings. The album's track listing is segmented into acts, perhaps the most notable break from past habits. The second act of the first song “Job’s Lament” is likely the closest we will ever get to a real single from the band; it acts as a propulsive and cathartic centerpiece for the album’s first half. Other highlights include the crushingly dour “Fire at Static Valley” and the triumphant “”GOVERNMENT CAME” (9980.0kHz 3617.1kHz 4521.0 kHz)”. For those who may have fallen off the wagon, this is easily their best album since 2012’s <em>Allelujah! Don’t Bend! Ascend!</em> and well worth the listen.`,

        content: `At some point after the dawn of the streaming era, the nomenclature for musical releases became muddled. Whether a particular collection of songs manages to be a mixtape, album, or EP seems less fixed on content or runtime and more focused on the intention of the artist. While potentially a confusing transition for the consumer I believe this to be a positive change moving forward. Florida based four piece Home Is Where insist their new 6 song, 18 minute release is an album proper, and I doubt anyone is inclined to argue after giving it a listen. Few bands feel so fully formed upon their debut, condensing the last three decades of midwestern emo and its various offshoots into one hell of an enjoyable ride. While it feels like a disservice to praise any particular track when the whole is so ironclad, “Long Distance Conjoined Twins” is a goddamn revelation from the moment the harmonica kicks in. I truly cannot get it out of my head. This release can stand toe to toe with anything from the 2010s emo revival: they pair the immediacy and brashness of Glocca Morra with the scrappiness of Cap’n Jazz. As amazing as this album is, it's easy to feel this group still has their best work ahead of them.`,

        content: `The hardcore-adjacent bonafides Fiddlehead follow up their debut with a more varied and textured record that doubles down on their alternative and emo influenced sound. Vocalist Patrick Flynn tackles familiar themes of grief and aging with an increased focus: “Come home &amp; fail with me to see that we are wrong / To try &amp; try for love we’ve had since we were young.” This directness comes from an increased understanding rather than renewed vigor -- there is a sense of world-weariness that pervades throughout. Despite this, <em>Between the Richness</em> seeks to recognize and celebrate the moments worth living for. Comprised of members from late aughts hardcore favorites Have Heart and alternative greats Basement, these are musicians committed to a more expansive definition of punk, reveling in the thought of seeing fans of Archers of Loaf and Madball attending the same gig. While unafraid to show their more abrasive edges, it's the saccharine 90’s-radio-friendly tracks like “Loverman and Joyboy” that provide<em> Between the Richness </em>a distinct identity. Every song on the album feels like its own two minute anthem built for a live audience. The most successful in that regard is “Down University” with Flynn’s direct addressal, “I know you are down, but are you out?”`,

        content: `The self-proclaimed mixtape <em>No Light in Heaven</em> from indie darlings Strange Ranger is difficult to pin down -- this record has few peers in alternative rock at the moment. Clocking in at a speedy 25 minutes, the Portland group manages to push the limits of the genre-hopping aesthetics lo-fi bedroom pop has been experimenting with for the last decade. Few records have the confidence to introduce and discard new ideas at the pace of <em>No Light in Heaven</em>: one of many hints at the sheer bulk of creative energy involved in this project. While Strange Ranger still knows how to write a moving pop song, the outfit seems restless to qualify these tracks with the same self-abasing and cheeky songwriting found in mid 80’s in sophisto-pop and jangle-pop. My personal highlight, the irreverent and light-hearted “Pass Me By” is a power ballad which eventually fades into a mock phone call accompanied by a gleaming guitar solo that would have been at home in a Sega Dreamcast title. The jarringly atonal opener “in Hell” and the ramones-esque pop punk banger “Demolished” are other peaks that demonstrate just how far the band has travelled from since their humble indie rock beginnings. For all its experimentation, this release remains engaging from start to finish, guaranteed to rattle around your brain for years to come.`,

        content: `A premonition of just how impressive 2021 would be for hardcore was the commotion around <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, the sophomore album from Seattle greats Regional Justice Center. Running at a brisk 13 minutes, this blistering LP draws inspiration from a wide swath of heavy music, creating a remarkably unique release in the typically stringent aesthetics of extreme hardcore. RJC’s first album focused on mass incarceration and the cycles these institutions perpetuate from a personal viewpoint, particularly dealing with the incarceration of Ian Shelton’s brother. <em>Crime and Punishment</em> continues in this vein, ruminating on the contentious environment he grew up in. While the A side sets the stage, it is the second half of the record that really lets loose with some of the most captivating music the band has put out. Back to back tracks “CONQUEST” and “CONCRETE” are particular standouts chronicling the constant anxiety to make a better life for oneself by any means necessary, followed by the consequences of being unable to do so. Final track “...AND PUNISHMENT” is the culmination of these themes in the comparatively long two minute epic, “Meant to thrive/ Left to die/ I wish there was a way to get back home.”`,

        content: `Dazy is the solo project of James Goodson, a member of several other punk bands from Richmond. This 24 song collection of the project’s first year of EP’s and singles was quite the surprise on a first listen; These low-fi tracks ooze style at every turn and retain a strong identity in the face of all Dazy’s obvious debt to 90’s pop punk. The compilation opens with arguably the highest energy tracks to be found -- “The Perfect Crime” and “Easy-Go-Round” manage to find a surprisingly idyllic middleground between Guided by Voices and the Tony Hawk Pro Skater Soundtrack. More downtempo tracks such as “Life Is The Slowest Blade” and “Don’t Leave Me On The Line” evoke contemporary power pop authority Tony Molina and mix it with an earnest love for the Lemonheads. The nature of a compilation such as this may wear out its welcome in a way an individual release would not, but this remains the best introduction to the project. Bonus points for best use of a drum machine in 2021.`,

        content: `Black Midi’s sophomore LP <em>Cavalcade</em> demands attention. The Croydon trio received critical acclaim with their breakout debut <em>Schlagenheim</em> and rather than rest on their laurels, they continued to push and bend their sound to a far-from-conventional shattering point. King Crimson references aside, <em>Cavalcade</em> finds inspiration in the ambitious excesses of progressive and hard rock to create a tracklist that can stand toe to toe among the era’s greats. Lead single “John L.” remains the highlight, showing the band at their most focused in a jagged looping end-of-times anthem that seems to taunt and challenge their audience on every repeated listen. The more surprising change was the addition of several stripped down low tempo tracks, which vary in their success: “Marlene Diech” and “Ascending 4ths” shine a new light on the group’s trademark humor and droll storytelling while “Diamond Stuff” struggles to be more than filler. Out of all the amazing music to come out of speedy wunderground in the last few years, Black Midi seems the most poised to take a slice out of the larger public consciousness. I wouldn't be surprised to see this band become the next guitar wielding festival headliner moving further into the decade. If nothing else, we can expect the next LP to be just as surprising a leap.`,

        content: `The English quintet’s steady output of pre-album EP’s and singles was some of my most cherished music in early 2020. The cacophonous and paranoid blend of tight percussion, shrill vocal delivery, and scampering melodies seemed to be a perfect fit for the times. When their debut finally landed many were surprised at its more somber tone: there was far less humor amongst their ever-present disquieting fixations. The album took a deep dive into the overwhelming mundanity found in the grind of day-to-day life and managed to surface with a strikingly personal collection of songs. The effective opener and moodsetter, “G.S.K.” uses the setting of a commute to examine our modern day dystopia, imagining a car crash taking place among the hustle and bustle of a rather pleasant seeming capitalist hellscape. The group’s knack for character-based songwriting comes into full display on the emotional centerpiece of the album, “Documentary Filmmaker”: “And a documentary filmmaker goes home at the end of the day/ But I'll sit and watch the seasons change.” Other highlights like “Boy Racers” and “Narrator” manage to perfect the Squid formula, zigzagging between infectious grooves and psychedelic excursions while lead singer and drummer Ollie Judge maintains the group’s inflated energy throughout.`,
